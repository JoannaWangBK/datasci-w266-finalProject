6099700,5,2,False,"07 6, 2016",A2NN1KIYEM2SKS,B01HJDNL60,,AF,"I reviewed the R2 Camera, so naturally being impressed with the R2 Im reviewing the N1 camera as well. While the size of the R2 is small the N1 is even smaller and a dainty little camera similar to the size of a GoPro. The resolution is 1080P with HDR, to be honest the quality is on par with the more expensive cameras at the same resolution, you can expect the same sharp and clear video. While the processor is not the most powerful out there, it does work well and there are no lags or delays in operation. The Novatek NT96650 processor and AR0330 color CMOS sensor is comparable to what you would find on similar sizes camera and monitor systems.

The mount is similar to the R2 mount with a suction cup design which really holds well and does not come off the windshield unlike cheaper mounts. The USB power connector is also like the R2, which is USB Mini and well integrated into the design so you can hide the cord as the orientation of the cord faces up to give you a nice and clean concealed look to hide the long cord under the headliner. Again like the R2 the cord is very long and you can easily hide the cable and have plenty left over if you want to direct wire and bypass the standard 12v adapter.

The one option I really like compared to the R2 is the recoding loop length which is longer than the R2 so there are less video clips to deal with. This option needs to be rolled over to R2 for sure. Just like the R2 there are two folders, Event Folder and Normal folder. The Event folder comes in handy when you get rear ended or you hit the emergency button which stores it in the SD card and does not get overwritten. Another great feature I wish the R2 would incorporate at the highest resolution is the ability to use the snapshot feature while recording, granted this is at 1080p. The snapshot upscales the image to 12MP and it does not distort the image.

Joe sent me a link to upgrade the firmware and this drove me nuts because the Version code did not match the firmware version. It turns out that this is an error on Vantrues part but the camera was successfully updated after all and the version number in the firmware file was not named properly. So folks, don't beat your head if you don't think the upgrade worked when it actually probably took if it shows V1 instead of V2.

Similar to the R2 the SD card slot is deep and a little difficult to remove easily, this is really not a big issue at all, just something to point out. I don't use the parking mode or the G-sensor because the parking mode will drain your cars battery and the internal battery is very small at 150mAh. If you however buy this camera for this function than I highly recommend a portable rechargeable battery which is dirt cheap and you can even get a solar battery pack so you don't even need to recharge using your cars battery. The sensor was a little too sensitive for me so I just turned it off but it can be a very useful feature if you park and get hit. The camera does not support GPS unlike the R2 but that is why you pay a premium for the R2.  There is no IR but the IR on the R2 and all dash cams available today are not a true IR camera anyway so it makes no difference.

The camera supports up to 64GB without any problems as long as it is formated to FAT32, make sure you use a Class 10 card to avoid any video delays and latency problems. Overall this is a great little camera with all the bells and whistles you would expect at this price point. It is very similar to the big brother in terms of GUI and interface so the transition between the two is seamless. Highly recommend this camera for a small footprint high quality 1080P camera.

And as usual Joe is great to deal with when you have questions",Small but very powerful,1467763200,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7118zlft22L._SY88.jpg']

Nope! You cant. Because the wiring is integrated into the mount, meaning there's a quick disconnect built into the mount that provides the camera with power.

Updating my rating to 1 star after 10 months of use.  This POC stopped loop recording by itself and didn't realize it until I tried downloading some videos today. Last recording was June 2017! Ive been seeing this power on everytime I started the car.  What I noticed was the memory card was full so likely it just stopped recording then. What pisses me off is I has loop recording set. And I do have the latest firmware. Glad I didn't have any incidents between June and now. But totally appalled at such an unreliable product.  I use a Samsung evo 32gb shdc class 10.



Camera is ok and does what's expected of it for the price.  What I hate is the mount.  I've had this item for just a month and the mount is wobbly already.  I think there is a design flaw in that the mount has some play left to right.  I tried tightening the 2 screws to no avail.

The folder structure this dashcam creates are clear and easy to use as well. There is an ""EVENTS"" directory and ""NORMAL"" directory. Recordings that detect an increase in G forces will automatically be saved in ""EVENTS"" and be un-deletable from the camera for protection.

Pros:
- compact size
- has a metal frame, not plastic
- stable during high and low temperatures. Just have not tried it during our hottest summer month.
- it records nice quality videos during day time.
- pictures are usable too
- great function to save currently recorded video without been in accident yourself. This one is useful, when accident happened without your involvement. Those kind of videos are helpful when you were a witness and are willing to help someone else.
- cord is very long and more than enough to go around the dash board to hide it.
- cigarette lighter plug will stay in no matter what. Well made.
- cigarette lighter plug has additional USB input, which is a nice feature, so you can use it for cell phone charger
- great idea about connecting the mount to the power instead of camera itself. With this one you basically mount your camera and don't have to deal with the cord itself, it's already plugged in to the mount.
- box, that came with this camera is professionally made and looks like a high quality product.
- customer services is relatively responsive if you have any questions.

Cons:
- A lock on the mount, which also serves as power cord connector, fell apart at first use. It is easy to put it back together, but should of been made better for the price
- Suction cup is not holding well, I had to purchase suction cup buddy to make it work. That's additional $3-6.
- Video looks like you are watching through the fish eye. Kind of weird feeling.
- >>>>> !!! GPS function requires additional attachment purchased separately. This is a huge disqualifying minus!!! <<<<<
- Green lights are blue on the video. Most white lights are blue as well.
- No memory cards included.
- Camera comes with installed system which is not upgraded to the latest available. After reading many feedbacks about camera failing as the result of updates, I decided not to play with it at all. Will rather use it as is  as it is usable.
- Night video recording is not so good. You can see some cars, some objects, but car numbers, colors and most other details are not visible in most cases. In case of the accident this video will help only to see who is at fault. And if it's not you, I doubt that insurance or police will be able to find the other one involved, if they diapered from the place, especially if you are going to use it during night time to record movements around your car.
- This camera is ok for $80-120, but not for $199.

As the result: for the front I decided to use an other dash camera because this one has a lower quality of the night time video than it's competitor.

The video is clear but 1080p looks more like DVD quality than full HD. Therefore, I use 720p. However, I found out that the interior of my windshield had a thin greasy film that I couldn't really notice which caused taillights and headlights to blur excessively. Once I clean it, it helped.

I initially put a 64GB micro SD card in and the unit does not recognize it until I put a 32GB one in.  So, it seems to be true that it only supports up to 32GB.  Perhaps due to the new firmware, the location of the GPS radar icon is actually on the right hand side of the screen instead of the left as the manual described.  The size of N1 is really small compare to my other cams.  I think the parking feature is great except you just need to use another power source after you park your car.  A portable battery will be just fine.  Emergency lock, IR LED light, and parking features are something I just don't have in all my previously used ones.

I haven't tried the viewer program and I need to explore it just to see how the GPS coordinates can be used in the presentation.  Also, I wonder if the unit can handle high outside temperature as recently been the case in Southern California.

6099752,4,,True,"12 8, 2016",A1PCIFSMGCT1PM,B01HJFFHTC,,Rhyph,"I bought this a couple weeks ago and held off doing a review right away to give it some time in use.  I recently purchased a new to me 2002 S500, which has no aux input, and all stock command radio system w/tape, cd changer, nav, etc.  I wanted to get music via bluetooth to the stock radio foremost, and as I was looking over various products, many also have phone call integration of some sorts like this does but I was skeptical.  Since I'm not brave enough to pull apart the dash to put in a hard wired unit yet, I wanted to give something simple in design a try.

So far my expectations have been somewhat exceeded.  The audio quality on calls, which I considered to be a bonus to my primary reason for purchasing this, is surprisingly excellent.  I've made numerous calls over the past two weeks and when I ask people about how I sound, they tell me great!  I basically sound as-if I'm talking directly on the phone (an iPhone 7).  Music plays over bluetooth and also sounds really good, I mostly run iHeart Radio or stuff from my direct playlists.

The only issue I've had is with intermittent radio interference in the form of a little static or hiss here and there.  I'm not sure there is much I can do to prevent it, being in the extremely radio band saturated area of metro Atlanta.  I've tried different positions, high and low, front and back within the confines that the cord will reach, but I've not found a better place.  With the very compact design of this device, I can't imagine they can pack a big transmitter and antenna in to it, but it does very well for it's size in my opinion.  What I have found really helps with the design of this, is the ease of switching stations on the fly.  I normally have found running on something like 88.1 stays extremely clear in my area (NE Atlanta suburbs) until I drive to the south side of the city.  I then have to switch to something like 88.3 and all is well again.  Since this is very easy to do by holding the button for a couple seconds, I don't really have to take my eyes off the road and I'm ok with this.

Over all, a decent little bluetooth transmitter with reasonable sound quality and surprisingly good hands free calling capability.  Since it stopped just short of knocking my socks off, I'm -1 star for the interference but maybe my expectations are a bit too high.  I wouldn't be afraid of buying another.",So far pretty decent!,1481155200,

I have two small children, ages 3 and 6, and I choose to give them a measure of freedom and responsibility in plugging in their own tablets as needed.  Now I get that it means I'll be going through cables frequently due to none too gentle use, and I except that there are few cables that can take that kind of abuse for long.  So I'm on a mission to try as many different brands as I can until I find one that is made well enough to last. I've tried dozens already and they've lasted from a few weeks to a few months.  With my particular setup, I have the wall outlet and USB charger in a place my kids can't reach, wich requires me to snake and zip tie cables to get them to where my kids can use them.  I purchased three of these and they no longer charge properly after a couple days and having them last only a couple of days is a pain, to say the least.

6739574,3,,False,"12 20, 2017",A3N2RW5MD9UIRZ,B01HJDNL60,,R. Campbell,"This review covers the Vantrue N1 and X2 dash cameras. I purchased both cameras and the optional GPS-equipped mounts. I have had no trouble with the N1 camera itself. The X2 was very problematic and I thought I'd never get it going. The camera griped about the formatting of the SD card (a high-quality class 10 card), even when the card was formatted by the camera. It froze, refused to turn off, emitted a loud hissing sound, etc. Contrary to what I've read here, Vantrue customer support was excellent. They replaced the camera with a new one, which worked just fine.

As others have said, the mounts have major problems sticking to the windshield. This includes the GPS-equipped mounts. Once again Vantrue's support folks came through and sent a new replacement mount, but it had the same problem staying on the glass. They finally offered to take everything back for a refund or to pay for a 3M sticky pad to attach the mount. I like the camera so I chose that route and I have had no further problems.

Pros: Decent cameras for the price, great customer support.

Cons: Unless the suction cups have been improved, the mounts are terrible. This includes the regular mounts and the GPS mounts. However, stick a sticky pad on the glass and then stick the mount to the pad and the cameras will be attached until the end of time. Not optional if you like to move the camera from car to car but you could get another mount and attach it to the other vehicle, and just move the camera itself.","Good camera, lousy suction cup on mount.",1513728000,
