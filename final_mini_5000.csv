What you get are digital copies of your vinyl recordings, but every single pop, skip, and scratch comes through.  In all fairness, you can use their software to edit out the worst of it.

Oh, and they had software for my Mac, which made me glad!

I didn't bother using the turntable to preserve any recording I could purchase via download or on a CD.  The sound I got using the turntable just wasn't as good.

ON the other hand- it was more than valuable in digitally preserving some recordings made on vinyl by my college band.

They pulled a stock image from Sigma, and the Pentax version will not have the FA-style focus distance window. Rather, it will have a more conventionally marked barrel. Your lens will not even look like the image on the box, and the paper insert will imply that it has HSM. It doesn't. Now I rarely use auto-focus, so it's not an issue for me. But it might be fore you. The lens IS auto-focus, just in the usual camera motor Pentax way.

This lens was introduced in 2005, I think. Its successor, the 10-20mm f3.5 in 2009. This one is $270 less. What you get with the newer, more expensive lens is that the f3.5 uses fewer lenses in fewer groups. This produces the only significant performance difference, which is flare. If you include the sun in the image, this lens will flare throughout. The f3.5 will also flare, but less. Of course, if you try to include a strong point source in a 10mm image, just about anything out there will flare some. Shoot without the sun in the scene and let Photoshop be out friend.

As expected with a super-wide, there is some CA, but it's mostly simple purple fringe and very fixable. I always would rather have less complex CA than a tad more sharpness, because complex CA is likely not fixable, and it amounts to the same thing as being less sharp, especially in terms of practical viewable image quality.

I've been doing serious photography since 1967, and it's a small miracle that such a lens can be made today.. It's good enough that it is my only non-Pentax lens.",Great - But No HSM for Pentax - Don't Get Confused,1425772800,

If you're looking to get a fuller sound from your car stereo, but you're not looking to give up half of your trunk, or you're trying to get a bit of bass in your truck cab, this won't disappoint, though the 10"" version has a bit more range to it.

This 8"" model struggles a bit with truly bass heavy music, but that's not a design flaw, it's a limitation of the 8"" speaker cone. If you're listening to something with blast-beats and heavy kick drum use it will be fine, but it might clip a bit for dub-step/rap. It certainly fills a space most car stereos don't out of the factory, but it's not without its limitations. If you're looking to buy an all in one unit, you're looking to make a compromise off the bat, these are cheaper and smaller units. They will give you some extra bass, they kick hard enough to feel it, and they fill out the sound at the low end.

2. The earplugs and rubber fittings weren't working for me. They were very uncomfortable. WAIT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS!!! Give them a second to get worked in and then they are perfect. It's like they were custom made after a few wears.

3. The clicker didn't seem to work at first. Give it a couple of good hard clicks and it will start working. One to answer calls, one to end calls. Same for starting and stopping music. Two for jumping ahead one track. Three for moving backwards a track. When you plug in the headphones, click once and the music starts right up.

With the autoblocker on, when someone calls who isn't whitelisted, they get a recording - A VERY SERIOUS VOICE WITH A NASTY TONE - that tells telemarketers to hang up. Other people can dial zero. If they dial zero, the call-blocker device then rings, but not the phone. So the caller doesn't have access to your answering machine. If he calls back again, it will then ring through to the answering machine. I changed the message on my answering machine to say, 'You have successfully reached the answering machine of xxx-xxx-xxxx. Leave a message.'

The autoblocker automatically wipes out all robocalls - none ever get through because the robot can't dial zero. And in two weeks of usage, not a single telemarketer has dialed zero and called back. I have received zero unwanted telephone messages.

On the other hand, several friends have called, heard the nasty message and dialed zero. They hung and called again, and got the answering machine, or I picked up. Then they got whitelisted.

Each day you can check the call list and put the unwanted calls on the blacklist. I have been doing that, but it probably isn't even necessary until a telemarketer or scammer actually dials zero and tries to get through. Once that happens, blacklist them. And when your friends get through, whitelist them. This obviously will get better and better over time.

There's enough noise outside (construction, wind, neighbors, trains, cars, birds, insects, etc.) that there's not a big need to worry about sound quality besides loud enough volume without distortion or strange artifacts.

The pair of speakers comes with two mounting brackets and hand screws to attach the speakers.  The brackets are steel and feel pretty sturdy.  It's hard to tighten the hand screws enough to feel that the speakers definitely won't move on you without also feeling that the plastic of the screws will break under the pressure.

* They use AAA battery, so you can carry virtually unlimited hours with you
* They don't require special software (i.e., itunes)
* They are much less expensive (about 1 quarter of the cost of the IPOD nano)
* Personally I think the shape is better than the rectangular IPOD shape (these are very small too)

They do have little quirks, for example they don't recognize ID3-2 MP3 tags, only ID3-1.  The screen is not nearly as sexy as an IPOD either.  But if you're only looking to carry 2GB of audio with you, does it really need to be?

I also own the note 8 and i feel the display and readability are both the same. I do not see a higher quality screen as compared to the note 8.

I thought this would be great for school, but nope, ill stick with my 3 year old sony vaio laptop which is much faster and versatile. If you think this will help you as a student, I would suggest pen and paper instead. By no means will this replace paper as some suggested. If they can adapt to this slow overpriced monstrosity, then all the power to them.

My note 8 I purchased for use in school and perhaps substitute paper and pen with but that's not the case either. I pretty much use it to reference material that on lecture or just entertainment since its so small. I've then left it home since its pretty useless in school as well.

Anyway, if you are a student considering to replace pen and paper, this is definitely something that WILL NOT perform that task. Stick with a nice small laptop and you will be just fine.

The first time you turn on the device you are guided through the setup process--keep the defaults for the most part, connect and sign in to your LAN, and you're done.  In contrast to the Sony BDP-S580 Blu-ray Disc Player I purchased last year whose menus and remote were apparently designed by committee who had never used the product, the LG BP330 has clear menus and a remote controller layout that easily corresponds to the actions on the screen.

The LG BP330 is bundled with the Nero MediaHome 4 Essentials allowing you to easily share media files over your LAN and play/display them on your TV/media center.

Logging in to Netflix, which was our sole reason for buying this device, is as simple as logging in.  Duh. Unlike the Sony that requires a process of registering the device separately with each online service and receiving back a secret code before getting access to log in.

Downsides: There is only a single HDMI output, so you can't connect to Svideo, RCA, component or composite devices. The devices is slow to process commands from the remote leaving you wondering if the request was received.

Yesterday I had my second outing with this lens. Of the images I have processed, I've seen very little distortion. I altered my approach to composing a shot to take into account the special capabilities of the wide angle.

This is the 3rd sleeve I've purchased for my 14-inch Lenovo Flex laptop.  The first one claimed to be canvas, but was actually printed neoprene complete with the chemical smell, which may have dissipated after time; however, if I'd have wanted neoprene, that's what I would have ordered.  It was also much bigger than it needed to be.  The second one was canvas and very nice, albeit, with no outside pocket.  Unfortunately, I knowingly ordered a 13.3 case hoping my 14-inch laptop would fit (after all, the fake canvas, neoprene one advertised for 14 inches was too big!).  Sadly, but as it should have been, it was too small.  Now back to this one.  I hesitated on this because ""neoprene"" is mentioned in the description.  It is actually made of canvas AND fits a 14-inch laptop PERFECTLY, looks gorgeous and has a nice feel to it, too.  Because it is actually canvas, there is NO chemical odor whatsoever.  If there is neoprene is must be contained inside the fabric lining, which is a very nice soft fuzzy fabric, with extra padding around the inside of the zipper, to protect your laptop from scratches.  As mentioned, mine had no odor at all.  The outside pocket is amazing, as well.  I can put my external CD drive and power cords in it and somehow it doesn't bulk up the sleeve, so it still looks great.  There are even pockets sewn into it (like a purse lining) to hold a cell phone, pens or whatever.  Did I mention the print is even more beautiful than it appears in the pictures?  It is!

Overall,"Had my 3-computer (Win 8.1 desktop, Win8.1 laptop, and Win7 laptop) Wi-Fi set up on a good Linsys router (N600).  Prevously, all was on an Ethernet tangle of wires which worked well, but wanted to move into the Wi-Fi world.  Got set up with good speed, at 30 Mbps.
Then my provider changed twice over a 1-year period, and the latest provider has done a good job generally.  But while the Win7 laptop was still on Ethernet, the other two were Wi-Fi.  I noted some speed loss, and ran my antivirus, ran a disc cleaner recommended by my IT pro son, made sure my disc was defragged, checked for disc problems, and damage to the platter.  Very little improvement.
Son then reminded me that Wi-Fi is generally slower than Ethernet, so if I wanted to return to 30+ Mbps from my current 4 to 15 Mbps, Ethernet was necessary, or try an (expensive) new router.
Put the desktop back on Ethernet, and got my 30+ Mbps back.  Hooray!  How about the Win8.1 laptop?  A wire across the desk (my setup) again?  Again my son came to my rescue, noting the laptop had an Intel Wi-Fi from 2 years ago, before 20+ Mbps was common.  Get a ""dongle"" instead that will handle the faster speed.  Not sure I want something hanging off my USB 3.0 port, but ok.
So ordered this (to match the router's capability) from Amazon, and when it came, installed it.  Voila!  back to 30 Mbps for the Wi-Fi laptop, bypassing the slower (obsolete?) Intel Wi-Fi.  Me like a LOT.  For the price, an inexpensive upgrade to stay near the (b)leading edge of computing.  Amazon got it here in two working days, solving the issue.  I am pleased with this item.  Uploads remain at about 5 Mbps, but downloads are FAST.
ADDENDUM: July 2015: Since then, the AC1200 dongle, together with a newer Linksys EA6350 will pull Charter's full 60+ Mbps Wi-Fi with no problems.  The AC1200 says it will only handle up to N300 or AC867, the 60+ is well below capacity, and doesn't bottleneck at all.  I don't have AC hardware OEM on either computer.  This newer setup is ""whizzbang"" Wi-Fi.  Windows 10 downloaded in just under 5 minutes (2.72 Gb) to both computers (desktop died), ready to install.  I have put Win10 on the Win 7 Toshiba laptop, and am learning it.  So far, no problems due to Wi-Fi.  Plan to upgrade the Win 8.1 HP laptop in the next week or so.  Both computers found no issues against updating (MS's compatibility wizard).
ADDENDUM: 7/10/2015: Desktop died (not Wi-Fi), now only two laptops.  Sudden failure of Wi-Fi a week ago, during research, found the basic dongle isn't supposed to work with Windows 8.1.  Upgraded to Linksys AC1200+ (Model 6350 has N300+AC867, I have only N).  Minor difficulty installing, but found thruput reduced.  Got USB3.0 version (two blue lights rather than one) AC1200, and restored 60 Mbps (max so far has been 65 with Charter!), and for a week now, it's magnificent.  Negative is that the dongle is slightly wider, so rubs against the USB plug for mouse on one side, power cord on the other, so no perfectly seated.  But running fine.  Still recommend for Win 8/8.1 with 6350 router.","Good, small upgrade for wi-fi",1411344000,

The provided documentation is practically useless...  referring to features and selections that either no longer exist, or are on some newer firmware which I don't have.

It went downhill from there.  I ran in to so many functional dead ends, I just gave up on any future expansion.  Its just too frustrating.

1) The leather-like case holds the tablet more securely
2) There is an opening for the camera
3) There is ample room and a secure band that holds the Dell active stylus between the keyboard and tablet
Just a couple of minor issues prevent the case from being outstanding:
1) The bluetooth keyboard takes a few keystrokes before it wakes up and produces output after the tablet goes to sleep.  The other keyboard in case that I tried had the same issue and looks identical to this one.  A separate HP keyboard did not have this issue.
2) The opening around the micro usb port is a bit too close making it a little difficult to plug in the standard Dell charger plug.

The lens and body on my old tripod took several seconds to stop wobbling and the pictures still came out a bit fuzzy.  So I looked for a tripod that could support up to 22 lbs (for a future Canon lens).  Well, this one does that and it's rock solid.  I haven't had any difficulty with the weight and I'm 59.  It's very configurable, easy to set up and easy to adjust.  The included (and attached) shoulder strap is nice and I use the tool kit to hang the handles from when I take them off for traveling in the car.

There is a negative (not with the tripod but with the quick release's).  The tripod comes with two quick releases but of different sizes.  I would have preferred they be the same size - one for the lens and one for the camera for when I'm using a different lens.  I had to go out and buy another quick release.

There is one oddity.  I like to take pictures of the moon with the 500mm (800mm on my T1i) which means I'm shooting up.  With the body/lens facing away from the controls, i.e. the controls are right in front of me for easy manipulation, I can't rotate the lens vertically enough to capture the moon; the rotation is only 30 degrees vertical.  There's an easy solution - remove the camera from the tripod and turn it around where the vertical rotation is 90 degrees.  This takes a bit getting used to as the controls are now behind the tripod.  In short, I think the 30 degrees is a bit shallow.  For all other uses it appears not to be a problem.",Just what I needed!,1308268800,

I do have a few quibbles:

- The screws that hold the front of the case on are very hard to screw in.  I had to leave one of them slightly protruding for fear that trying to screw it in the rest of the way would strip the head.  That would make it difficult difficult / impossible to physically access the enclosed drive.  Definitely one star subtracted for this.

- The indicator light on the front of the front panel is too bright.  I have noticed that a lot of manufacturers do this with their hard drive enclosures, but I find it very distracting (particularly when the room is dark).  I ended up disconnecting the indicator light.  Fortunately, that is easy to do with this case.

- The case has a mirror finish.  I know many people like this, but I find it a nuisance - the least bit of handling, such as repositioning the case on my desktop - leaves it covered with very obvious fingerprints.  It is then necessary to clean the case, or it will look terrible.  A low gloss finish would have been much more practical.","Does the job well enough, but a few quibbles",1383350400,

The big cameras are usually turned away at the door.  This one was small enough that it doesn't look like a full production.  The camera feels well built, not cheap.  It does feel like something you could drop so make sure you get some kind of wrist strap.

FLASH:  I hate the flash.  It blows everything out. It attached to the top and sets up at 45 degrees.  I can't believe they didn't let it rotate straight up or even back to bounce light.  Would have made the flash sooooo much better and usable.

CASE:  You need protection on this camera.  I found an awesome case, guarantee it's the best you can get for this with a little mod. Get the Lowepro DV 35 for 13 dollars.  (When it gets there CAREFULLY cut out side straps and sim card holder.  It will open up like a clam and be a an unbelievable case that fits snugly and secure.  Will also hold your flash case.  Trust me on this.

LOW LIGHT:  I thought the camera did a fairly good job in low light.  Like anything, you gotta shoot a bunch to get a few.  It handled the colors pretty good.  One thing thats cool is when it shoots multiple shots at once, like 9.  Then it pieces them all together to make one great shot.  Its pretty unreal.  I felt like I shot better shots in the manual mode adjusting the ISO myself. I included a couple photos from an Easton Corbin concert.

 WIFI:  You can drop photos right onto your phone for upload to Facebook.  Pretty cool.  You may be able to upload to computer wifi as well.

OUTSIDE LIGHT:  Shoots really nice shots.  here is where this unit shines.  It may not be high end camera stuff but if you know what you're doing you can get it damn close.

VIDEO:  Good video, probably comparable to iPhone 6.

OVERALL:  If you want a good camera that you can take with you on the go this is it.  It's not as compact as others but it's not as large as a full blown cannon.

I asked to speak to a manager/supervisor and got on on the chat, which kept disconnecting because of their server issues. So he asked if he could call me.

Since the touch screen haven't caught in quality of the non-touch (color, clarity...etc) I decided to go with a non-touch. I was originally looking at 27"" with 2560x1440 resolution and preferably with USB 3.0 ports. I spent quite a bit of time skimming over forums and reading about those who review monitors in great detail. Since I couldn't make up my mind at the time and I decided to wait until fall to see if anything with the touch screen would come out that was similar in quality but not so.

I hit the forums again and this BenQ BL3200PT came up. The reviews were very good. There were some complaints but they seemed few and it can be difficult to determine some times if it's the user or the hardware. I opted to go with this 32"" instead as I have the real estate for it on my desk and had been reading that the 2560x1440 resolution worked better on a 32"" rather than a 27"". The 2560x1440 resolution seemed to be to high a res for a 27"" monitor for reading and more pleasing on a 32"".  I'm still getting used to the size as I used a 20"" for so many years. I always tend to buy up from what I need so as time goes on I tend to be happy with my purchase. BenQ has been around for a while but I admit I was reluctant at first not being that familiar with the brand. But the warranty on this was on par with other known manufacturers and it seems BenQ is making a name for themselves. For this size of monitor it has a lot of very good qualities that seem to meet across a broad spectrum of users. Seems to even do well for gamers which is unusual for this size. Colors are amazing. Transitions between colors are very smooth (this supports over 1 billion colors). Response time has been great and I have not seen any issues with anything I've done so far.  I work in Photoshop, Dreamweaver, in different browsers a lot on the web, I use various apps like Quicken, Outlook and a variety of tech tools.

I'm still working on utilizing the size of this thing. The software that is provided by BenQ (Display Pilot) is handy and you can set it to divide up the screen for your apps. IE: what position and what size of windows you want. A little icon will sit in the upper right corner of the app and you can click what size and where to position it. You can customize the windows sizes as well. Currently I'm using a virtual desktop app called Dexpot. This allows you to create a few to multiple different desktops that you can flip through. This might be handier if you're concerned about being able to read as you could open an app to full screen instead of splitting the screen up with multiple windows.  The location to attach video cables is much easier (on the right side instead of coming up from underneath at the bottom), the USB (all 3.0) hub is on the right which I prefer being right handed and there is a built in SD card reader. The stand is very nice and easily adjustable which can also go into portrait mode for this 32"" monitor. If you do this...play with this a bit to see how it works as I found you have to tilt it a bit on its axis to go into portrait mode. Not just raise it straight up on the stand and pivot it into portrait mode. I also really like the thin bezel on this monitor. When you see the monitor is mostly all screen which is where you want to focus. As for colors the blacks are great and transition very nice. I've noticed when looking at several pics that the colors are great and, again, the transitions are very nice and especially with the blacks. There are a lot of adjustments that can be made with this monitor and after all the research I did I went with the recommendations. Based on what I read it sounds like for most that out of the box will do fine. For those who notice detail and/or have a trained eye the tweaks were easy to do and beneficial. The puck that comes with may be handy for many but since this monitor sits back a ways on my desk I just use the software that you install and access like any app and make my changes from there instead of the touch menu on the bezel (which will illuminate when your hand is near). Be sure to connect the USB cable, for this feature to work, to your PC so you can access it.

It has an attractive design and placement to different functions were thought through. Cable organizer is helpful. It does have built in speakers which I muted in the control panel and don't even have connected. Then stand is attractive and very sturdy. There is no built in camera and I already have an HD 1080P cam anyway.

Note: this is a larger monitor so consider taking it out of the box carefully and maybe assembling it on your bed. Perhaps not necessary for some but I found it helpful working with the larger monitor and working on a soft surface as to not damage it. It goes together easily. When switching a monitor this size between landscape and portrait do so gently. It's not hard to do and the stand can handle it but you may notice some wobble due to the size of the monitor. If you do this you'll understand. Also, if you plan to use the 2560x1440 resolution with DVI it works great with the provided DVI cable which is Dual Link DVI. A standard or non-dual link will not get you to 2560x1440.",Wonderful monitor!,1416096000,

Definitely shop around to see what the prices are like.  I initially was set to buy my memory from Newegg, but the price shot up of the specific kit I was looking at.  Also keep in mind that just because a kit is more expensive and super fancy looking doesn't mean that it'll work as fast.  It's all dependent on the speed that the kit can handle.

I have been using Toshiba for years in the late 90s and early 2000s from high school to undergrads. They are always not top tier specs, made of plastic and doesn't look fancy, but very toughly built and comfort to use. I have been dropping, slamming, knocking on walls etc and they still lives. After then I bought my Gaming ASUS, have used normal (low) specs HP and Dell, a nice Alienware, etc. But I've always been missing my old Toshiba and that Old ASUS (if you know G series of ASUS you know how well their ventilation works).

I have been using a HP I got from a friend for 3 years since I don't play games on laptops. I have recently got a MSI PE60 for me for the HP is dying and running very slow even with a SSD, plus the MSI has a good deal then. I was going to get either PE60 or PE70 for my girlfriend whose computer is also due for an update. We've been waiting for a deal of them for months and finally figured not to wait. Just before we placed the order, this laptop pops up on Amazon recommendations. Brush Aluminum A and C panel, USB 3.0, IPS full HD touch screen, up to date i7 6700HQ with 12GB RAM and 128GB SSD+1TB HDD. All these specs looks very attractive from a reputable brand. Only the HDD is 5400rpm which is quite slow (standard) and the Graphic card is only GTX950 not 960 as of my MSI. But my girlfriend don't play big games, most she would do is watching youtube, work on Office and Reaper, etc. So this should not be an issue.

When it first arrived I knew my bet was right. It seems to be very quality built on picture and the real computer is even prettier. My gf fell in love with it on the first sight. The brush metal is not bright silver like my MSI but rather a warmer metal silver color. All edges are smooth and even. Touch screen is easy to use and works as good as an iPad. Harman/Kardon speakers are clear as always. Keyboard has backlights, but not as responsive as my MSI, just noticed this when typing this review.

I asked the community before if this laptop has two fans since I see there are two vents on the sides. And there are rather less videos or pictures about this laptop online. I have only see one picture of an older model being opened up with one fan in place but an empty fan bay on the other side. I guess that one doesn't have the NVidia card. But this one has 2 Fans confirmed. Please see my open up picture below. There's no optical driver. With this model there has one 128GB SSD utilizing the M2 port. This is a size only good for installing system on it and possible future updates and Virtual Memory, but will be too small for other software. Your option could be either get a bigger M2 SSD to replace this one, then keep the 1TB slow HDD to store videos, music, etc; or replace that 1TB HDD for an SSD (like I did in the picture) to install software and getting faster speeds. I moved her EVO840 from her old laptop to replace this HDD. Works well so far. 12GB DDR3 RAM (one 8GB and one 4GB). The RAM has its own door on the back. So if you want to replace the Harddrives you will have to remove the whole back panel, but if you want to upgrade the memory in the future, you can only unscreen that one screen and open the small door to do so. This is really good feature.

Now talking about built quality, my MSI PE60 is a more powerful laptop for sure, and it has the same type metal A and C panel, Plastic B and D panel design. But when I putting back the D panel (i.e. the bottom cover) for the first time, I mistakenly put it 1mm off the spec. I didn't noticed that until 2 weeks later after I have constantly hearing plastic noise under wrist rest. So I have to take it apart and put back together very carefully, finally got it aligned correctly. For this Toshiba? there is no way you can mis-align the D panel. It was so strong and designed so well that there's basically 0 chances you could get it wrong. and after you put them together, it still feels like being carved from a whole piece of aluminum. I'd say the craftsmanship of this Toshiba is no worse than my Apple Air.

Now the not so fancy part. Battery is only 4 cell, 2800mAh just to make it slim. It's even smaller than my cellphone battery. Hopefully there could be an 8 cell battery coming out soon even if it sticks out a little. That will not only extend the battery life, but also work as an ventilation stand as well. The ventilation is good. 2 fans works as they should. The heat tube on this one is thinner than my MSI, which appears to be a little warmer under hand wrist and space bar area, and the fans turns up more frequently than my MSI. But it is not any where near unbearable or annoying. Just a little warmer than that I would like.

All in all, it is a really nice laptop. if you are hesitate on the popularity of Toshiba, I would have to tell you this company used to make computers and other electronics for the military. They have really good quality control. Oh, talking about quality I have to mention. Unlike my MSI or other current laptop brands like HP, etc. This laptop has a rubber case surrounding the hard drive all way round to protect it. You can see it from the picture. maybe not so important for an ssd, but still good to have, and it's a must if you want to keep the HDD in place.",Quality built piece of metal art.,1466208000,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71G6783bn0L._SY88.jpg']

1) the 4-pin fan headers on the chassis are not true PWM! one fried Noctua Industrial series fan later I have come to learn that while they look like PWM fan headers they are not. So just buy 3-pin fans to avoid any problems.

2) the AI Suite software is buggy. My fans often show up mapped to different fan headers in Thermal Radar but according to Aida64 and my BIOS they are correct, i.e. my CHA FAN 1 showing up as disconnected while my AST FAN 2 shows up with this fan. However, since connecting all four chassis fan headers to fans I haven't had any of those issues.

3) the stock settings for overclocking run the i7-4790K a wee bit too hot, with voltages getting into the 1.3+ range and for no reason. Right now I have mine limited to 1.275 V at 4.6 Ghz with no stability issues.

Those reasons are why I knocked it a star. Other than that the board is pretty solid and I feel very comfortable with it holding my system together. Also, the usb 3.1 ports run kinda hot for not being used, about 60 C, but I just disabled them and they're fine and still functional as 3.0 ports, I think I know they have power but I am not certain on the transfer speeds.","Great TUF board, but with some misleading details....",1438992000,

If you want a keyboard for a tablet, this is exactly what you want, its very good looking, very easy to type on, and man does it work great.  To no fault of the keyboard but due to some software on the tablet, there is in some applications an interesting lag which causes what you type to come out of the keyboard slow and garbled.

From reading the reviews, I thought that this would be a good replacement, especially having the HDMI output, which I wanted to use with my HD TV.

After installing this card, playing with settings, and contacting EVGA support, I could not get it to work.  EVGA support suggested that the cause is that my PC's power supply was not large enough wattage.  My PC had a 300 Watt power supply, but EVGA recommends 350 Watt or higher.  Since my PC was already 6 years old, I did not want to put out money for both the graphics card and the power supply.

So I returned the graphics card, and bought a HDMI converter that runs off the PC's USB 2.0 port.  That did the trick, and was $15 less than the EVGA card.  I now use my old PC to watch internet videos on my HD TV.  (See my review of the tekcity USB 2.0 to HDMI DVI Video Converter with 3.5mm Audio Cable 1080P HDTV CRT LCD Projector for more on that.)

Unfortunately, I cannot rate the card's performance since I could not get it to work.  It does not mean that the card did not work.  It was just that the Amazon ad did not show that the PC required a minimum power supply wattage to work correctly.",Did Not Work on My HP Tower PC,1351209600,

I was expecting the Onkyo to be far easier to set up than the older Denon (it was) but I was not expecting such a dramatic improvement in sound and functionality! Wow! I am an audiophile from way back and am very fussy about sound quality. I will leave it to others to detail each and every feature of this receiver. Let me just say that after you set this receiver up, using the excellent guided on-screen set-up menus, and the automatic speaker set-up using the supplied mic, hit the THX button and be prepared to be blown away. There may be better sounding receivers on the market, but I haven't heard any. Another favorite feature is the network connection (WiFi or hard-wired) which allows you to connect to lots of different Internet radio stations. If you're a Top 40 kind of person, you can skip this comment. So within minutes, using the ""Tune-In"" app on the receiver, I had found my favorite stations from RadioTunes, and from KEXP Seattle, KCSM San Mateo jazz, etc. The sound quality of these radio streams is excellent, and it's free. So if you are a music junkie like me, and you'd like to listen to radio stations from around the country or around the world, look no further. The only suggestion I'd have for Onkyo is that some kind of a backlit remote would be nice. The remote buttons are tiny and numerous, but in the dark, it's impossible to see which is which.

3 of Cooling Fan-AFB1212GHE-CF00 120x 38mm - TAC Sensor, 3-pin, 240.96CFM, 5200RPM, 62dBA, 2.45A (Max 3.24A), 27.48 air pre.
The thing I learned about all of these little fans is that you have to pay attention to the #'s.  CFM is ""cubic feet per minute"" basically how much air it moves.  Be aware this fan is strong it moves more air than a hair dryer.  RPM is speed and dBA is how loud it is.  I purchased other fans before I learned about the #'s and some of them didn't move enough air to blow a piece of paper.  These fans are loud.  I actually purchased 3 fans and with all 3 fans going it was too much wind and too loud so I bought this.
Lamptron FC2 Fan Speed Controller 45W x 6 channel Black
This allows me to control the speed of the fans which affect how much air they move and how loud they are.  This was one of the only speed controllers I could use because most of them could not handle a fan that required as much amperage as these do.  The next problem I had to solve was how to get the fans to turn on when the receiver comes on.  I tried a thermostat that is designed to turn on a certain temperatures but it had a limited range so it didn't work.  I also tried a thermal probe from another company but its power supply failed as soon as I connected it to the fans.  Then I found this
Smart Strip SCG3 Energy Saving Power Strip with Autoswitching Technology
You connect the receiver to what is called the master plug and the other outlets don't receive any power until they sense the master plus is drawing power.  I didn't want to wait for delivery to so I bought two different brands from home depot and lowes but the receiver draws too much power even when its off so they didn't work right.  The Smart Strip has a dial on the side that you can adjust the sensitivity (this is a big benefit I'm not sure why they don't hype it in the description, I wouldn't have known if it wasn't for a review I read).  It took a couple of minutes to get it just right but now it all works perfect.  When I turn on the receiver the power stip senses the power is on and provides power to the fan controller which is perfectly set to turn the fans at the speed I want so they aren't too loud but keep my electronics nice and cool.  I even found a local metal shop to build a nice bracket for me for $25 to hold the fans.  This took several trials and errors but now it works perfectly.  Hopefully this will help someone else in the future.  I would definitely recommend all of these products.",Sensitiviy Dial very helpful,1340496000,

Finally I purchased the Garmin V and was not disappointed.  In addition to all of the capabilities of the GPS 12 that I have become so fond, the G-V added several new capabilities to the formula.
The ""FIND"" or Auto-Routing has been a terrific bonus.  I recently located a piece of property that was listed for sale.  It was tucked away in a very obscure part of the area, and would have been nearly impossible to locate with ""turn by the blue house; go straight until you reach the tree"" kind of ""human"" directions that it would have required.  Instead, we drove confidently to the location, knowing where we were every step of the way.
We also love looking up Points of Interest (Restaurants, Shopping, etc.) - it has enhanced our travels by encouraging us to take the road less traveled knowing that at least we can find our way in and back out!
Adding the external antenna greatly increased the reception quality of the unit.  We routinely get accuracy reported to within 15 feet!
The unit is compatible with other Garmin accessories I already own, is feature-rich yet intuitive for users like me.  I have already been able to convert and use several of the hundreds of tracks I recorded with my GPS 12.
Combine this unit with City Select and Topo and you have a combination that will take you to some of the most interesting (and sometimes well hidden) places on the planet.  You will know what time you can expect to arrive, find a place to get a meal, and even get some fishing tips if that's your fancy.  Tonight we wanted to check a restaurant for specials and waiting times.  I looked it up on the GPS on the way to the location and called ahead for the answer to all my questions!

After my initial review and 3-star rating, someone from The Friendly Swede contacted me and thanked me for my feedback, offering me a replacement set of my choice.  I was leaning toward just getting another set of the 5.5"" thin tipped version- thinking it was a fluke that one of the 3 I originally received seemed defective (more on that later).  But I was also curious about the 4.5"" thicker tipped ones since they were shorter and might be a little more convenient to keep with my tablet.  I ended up going with the 5.5"" ones, but they ALSO included a set of the 4.5"" styli!!  And both reps I dealt with were extremely friendly and nice.  This is clearly a company dedicated to great customer service.

So now I've had a chance to test both types from the Friendly Swede, and also a few other styli (including Wacom Bamboo).  Hands down, Friendly Swede wins for excellent quality and value, and outstanding customer service. And the colors they offer are gorgeous.  I've had to adjust my expectations about how a capacitive stylus is supposed to work.  Basically, it isn't a pen- and even the thinnest of styli aren't going to give you the experience of a pen on paper.  The new Microsoft Surface has a very thin tipped, pressure sensitive Pro Pen-which is kind of what I had expected in a stylus.  But that is a special technology- and it's still not the same as paper and pen- it feels weird to have a hard tip writing on glass.

So now, knowing the limits of capacitive styli, and having spent quite some time playing with different types, I am very happy with the Friendly Swede styli. Even the silver one I originally thought was defective isn't so bad, now that my expectations are adjusted.  I can't see any reason to ever purchase another brand of stylus.

Original review- 1/8/2014

I wanted to love these, I really did.  Based on the ratings, everyone else does.  But the tips are not as thin as I expected, and the first one I tried out of the package (silver) didn't work very well- I had to press REALLY hard in order to get my Nexus 7 to respond.  I tried the next one (black) and it was a little better- but I still had to press hard and it was not as precise as I would have liked.  The third one (red) was about the same as the black, maybe a little better.  But none of them are as precise or responsive as the  ballpoint pen/penlight/stylus gizmo I got as a gift a few months ago, which these were intended to replace.

Upon further inspection, the tip on the silver stylus sticks out a lot further than the other two.  I tried changing out the tip, but no matter what tip or cowling I put on the silver one, it always sticks out a lot further.  I think this is the source of the problem- the tip sticks out too far and creates a little bubble at the end of the stylus that is too fragile/squishy.  If you hold the styli up side by side, the silver sticks out the furthest, the black sticks out less, and the red a little less than that-which roughly corresponds to their performance.  All of them stick out further than the pen/stylus I've been using- and because the tips are narrower, it makes them less stable.

Other than that, they're great- the form factor is good, I love the lanyards, and they are a great value.  My husband tried them out on his Microsoft Surface and he agreed the silver one is a problem but he finds the other two OK.  So we will be keeping them. But I will continue searching for another solution.  I just can't get used to writing with a fat, imprecise stylus.  Maybe I'm just too picky and I should give up on the idea entirely- I suppose you can't expect a stylus on a tablet to ever approach pen and paper.",Initially a bit disappointed- but now very happy!,1389139200,

I would recommend pairing them up with nicer headphones though.  I have burned them in for many hours now.  Easily over 100.  I have noticed that the virtual surround sound that the sabrent provides is now noticeable.  In counter-strike for example, i can pin point people through walls just by hearing their footsteps and then prefire them before they come out.  It works great for HD audio files too.  The sabrent has its own mixer and effects software as well as speaker location with a sub in the virtual surround sound section.  It also has a built in voice morpher, which I haven't been able to get working yet.  I've just been plugging my mic into the onboard jack of my mobo.  The worst issue I had was that the software manager always crashed any time I played the game Dragon Nest.  I am guessing this is because of the anti-cheat program that goes along with games like that.  I gave it 4 because I couldn't get a few things to work, but it is overall a steal at under $20 by far.

Several radio stations where I worked as producer and announcer had various sets of Sennheisers, all of them on-the-ear types instead of around-the-ear, (which is the design that the RS 140's incorporates,) and they all were lifeless, annoying POS's.

Sony 7506's are my favorite mid-priced phones, and I hoped that in some ways these RS 140's would come close. They DID!

The sound is surprisingly full-range, with satisfying but not over-hyped bass, and smooth highs. I doubt if they go much above 12KHz but for TV listening and casual CD enjoyment they are very good.

One side-benefit I didn't expect is the ability to keep track of a movie or TV show while raiding the icebox. Though there is some increased hiss when more than 3 walls away from the transmitter, it's still possible to hear the dialog. Very cool.

I had bought these for late-night Home Theater use and for this purpose they have been about perfect.

Pluses:
-Hold a charge for many hours of use.
-Recharge automatically on the stand.
-Great noise rejection from nearby equipment such as CRT and amplifier transformers.
-Comfortable for normal vertical wear, extended periods.
-Get really loud if you want 'em to.
-Nice, well-balanced response and relatively low noise floor.
-3 selectable Channels for best reception or using different units in same house.
-You can use normal rechargable ""AAA"" batteries when the originals wear out (Powerex Imedion recommended,) so no need for any propriatory replacement battery cells.

Minuses:
-Volume knob susceptible to unwanted changes by accidentally brushing against pillows (-a strip of blue painters tape will cure this).
-The warning beeps that the transmitter is turning off are unnecessarily loud.
-They are HUGE. They stick out like a Roger Ramjet helmet.
-Not that comfortable to wear while laying on your side. (waa waaa, I know).

All in all for the price this setup is a definite ""go"" and I'll wager most users will be very happy with these.

That said, I see every reason to buy a protective filter such as this one to avoid damage to my glass.  This is a very stout filter that has been very durable and offer outstanding photo quality.

Both time I got the -C model, since I live in Texas and our summers are excruciating. The first one I bought is flawless, except for the fact that maybe once a week or two, when it boots up, it says there is no SD card inserted (when in fact it is). This is solved easily by simply pushing the card out and then in again. For the price I don't mind, still a great camera.

My second -C model however, I notice that it won't turn on in the morning when I turn my car on. I have to manually unplug the cable, then plug back in (all while car is on obviously) and it will turn on again no problem. This problem only arises in the morning so I'm assuming that if it's off for too long it will not turn on initially (despite there being a red light on the cable showing that there's power running through it). The rest of the day is flawless and turns on immediately, something my old camera didn't do.

So with that annoyance that I have to deal with in the morning, I still give it a 4/5 stars. The video and audio is as great as you'd expect from a 1080P camera.

The mouse, eh.. it's all right but there's some minor gripes. One gripe universally that affects both the mouse and keyboard is the USB dongle. It's a bit too long and I would prefer the dongle from the MS Sculpt keyboards or Logitech transceivers. They're just smaller, more compact, seem more durable and doesn't get in the way. I'll review the mouse and the keyboard's pros and cons separately.

Keyboard:
Pros: Not a split keyboard so it's a bit smaller in width than most ergo keyboards which ensures closer mouse placement for less RSI strain. (Plenty of people forget about mouse placement and how it affects you). Its keys are quiet and it gives a durable feeling to it overall. Simple and effective layout for an everyday user. The palm rest is nice and the overall keyboard has a sleek and cool look to it.

Cons: You have to download the driver from Microsoft's website to customize the extra keys (1-5) and to see if the lock keys are activated. When accessing some of the lock keys, ex.""Function lock"", which I and many others prefer a regular toggle button and not a lock function; it doesn't indicate whether it's activated without the driver. A simple light indicator to show whether the keys are ""locked"" or not would be helpful. I also don't like the fact that there's 2 removable ""legs"" to raise the board. I would prefer everything be attached so there's no extra pieces that could get lost. Lastly, there's a couple of buttons that you're not sure what it does and it would help if the manual indicated their functions. (TIP: the button next to the right ALT is a switch task button, and you might need the driver for it to work properly. At least, I'm pressing it without the driver, and nothing is happening).

Mouse:
Pros: It's a larger mouse so it fits in the palm of your hand fuller, which can be helpful since you don't want to be gripping too hard or over-exerting your hand muscles.
Cons: The mouse is just a bit awkward itself. The back and forward keys are on both opposite ends of your hands so your ring finger would unconsciously hit the forward key when just holding the mouse. One note: I couldn't find an ON/OFF button on the mouse (apparently it's on the bottom, but I must've missed it when I looked there).

So there you have it. A good keyboard (albeit a few gripes) overall with an okay mouse combo. Decent affordable price. A bit more compact which is nice for RSI/Carpal sufferers to have closer mouse placement. It's probably one of the more affordable keyboards on Amazon that doesn't cut too many corners on quality.","Good keyboard, okay mouse. Affordable.",1479254400,

First with Windows 7, copying and pasting about 20GB of data from windows explorer to the external harddrive using the legacy USB 2.0 ports, I saw a data transfer rate of about 20MB/S. Using the same harddrive but connected to the J-Tech USB 3.0 adapter, I was seeing transfer rates of about 52MB/S. Going the other direction and copying from the external harddrive back to my laptop hard drive I saw about 30MB/S using USB 2.0 and about 46MB/S using the J-Tech adapter.

I also tested the adapter out using Ubuntu Linux. The adapter worked right out of the box when I booted up Ubuntu. No driver or software installation was required. However, I did not see quite the same speeds as when I used Windows 7. I was only seeing about 33MB/S in either direction.

All things considered, I am happy with this product. No it is not getting full USB 3.0 speeds, but I am seeing significant speed increases over my legacy USB 2.0 ports.

The tripod stands are about as heavy as my least expensive kit, but definitely feel sturdier. I'd say if they weighed a bit more, they'd be close to be on par with my pro lights stands, but I prefer it to be lighter because I'll be carrying it a lot for production, out in the field. The individual carrying bags are a nice bonus!

It has the normal tripod screw, so you can attach just about everything compatible.
For heavy rigs, you can just place some sandbags to the legs and it should hold still for situations with strong winds and some uneven grounds.

There is a groove to the side of the tubing, so you won't be able to rotate a camera or light by unclipping the lock, but that just makes it more secure for my need.

I control a Samsung TV, a MacMini, a Pioneer 5.1 sound system and a Tivo all from the same remote. The setup is relatively easy (could be more intuitive) and it's still customizable. It's a little annoying that you have to have an online account to set it up, but for the most part it's worth it.

But now it's starting to wear. The play, pause, fast forward and skip forward buttons take extra ooomph to work. They used to work great. Maybe as a Tivo user I rely on them too much? I honestly don't know. But now, I have to really press on them for it to work. I imagine in another month, it will become unusable.

I had expected this remote to last the life of my Television and Tivo. Eight-five dollar is a a steal for this remote. But $85 ever 14 months is a complete rip.

Edit: December 18, 2008

I was reading other posts complaining about the longevity of the buttons when I came across a suggstion made by Terry Solomon. Following Terry's advice I disassembled the remote (six screws in total) and cleaned all the contact with nail polish remover . . . good as new! Ten minutes of effort and I now once again love my remote. It'd be nice if Logitech made it easier to take apart to clean or better still if they provided some instructions.

Material feels pretty nice in my hand. Shape is comfy as well.

Able to learn other remote controls without looking up codes - great if you only need a couple buttons from an old remote and don't want to keep switching devices on the remote. (I do this for an HDMI switch)

Back-light makes all the buttons easy to read. Buttons are all evenly lit with plenty of contrast, unlike some cheapo remote controls.

They have FINALLY released some bluetooth buds with that feature in the X7's. It works just as great as it does in the wired buds...

The fit on these is phenomenal. Once you get the memory wire adjusted, they stay put and you forget about them. The profile of the in-ear piece is fairly low. This should allow for comfortable fit beneath a winter hat, or beneath a hood and eliminate the annoying rubbing so many other bulky plugs have. The controller is not as bulky as it looks. Due to the low profile fit, the controller essentially lays close to the back of your head, almost flush, once you have the plugs properly inserted and the cinch tab in the back pulled taught. The controls have a nice reveal for easy access without fumbling around. It'd be nice if the buttons had more distinctive shapes for better tactile feel. The three circles all feel the same and you'll have to just make sure which one you're on before you depress the button. This is only a minor inconvenience though.

MicroUSB charging makes these a winner in my book! They charge very quickly (90 mins tops) and they promise to hold a charge for a good while, I've yet to test this yet.

There's voice confirmation when you turn it on and connect to your device...that's a nice feature. The voice is kinda cheesy and tinny sounding vs. the voice feedback I had with some Motorola Bluetooth headphones i'd previously owned...but that's minor. It's nice to have that vocal confirmation of connection instead of trying to interpret beeps and lights....

Build quality is great. Time will tell how well they hold up. It's an all plastic affair, and you can see the mould/joinery...but it's not offensive. The ""chrome"" is not metal, it's painted plastic. I imagine real metal would have added to the weight, so that's not a big deal. I'd have preferred all black to the fake chrome though. The 1-year warranty is comforting.

I hate the MEELectronics logo. I wish they'd step it up to match the quality of their products.

Price wise these are a STEAL and a great value.

I bought this camera a month ago directly from the Kodak online store.  Upon arrival, the camera displayed noticeable vertical lines in all of the modes except 1080p.  These vertical lines appeared both on the external LCD display as well as when the files were transferred to a computer.  I tried three different SDHC cards (all class 6), and upgrading the firmware.  No dice.  Additionally, the internal microphone had that high pitched whine sound that has been mentioned a lot (contrary to what many say, the firmware did NOTHING to fix this problem, at least for me).  I called Kodak's tech support, and they told me the camera would need to be sent in for repairs, covered under warranty.  I had to pay $20 non-reimbursed shipping to send it off, but I did anyway.  The facility, an outsourced repair center called Precision Camera and Video Repair had the camera for about three weeks.  They claimed they replaced the main CPU and power circuit.

I received the camera yesterday, exactly one month after I initially received it, and the same exact problems persist.  Once again, I tried different cards and upgraded firmware.  No help whatsoever.  Additionally, the repair facility scratched the external screen up pretty good, something that was NOT there when I sent it in.  So I called tech support again, and said I want a new camera.  They said they can't do that, and that I would need to send it back...to the SAME repair facility, and spending my OWN shipping costs again.  I said that was unacceptable, and they transferred me to store customer service.  They said that they could not replace the camera since it had been repaired...something that tech support assured me would fix the problem.  I was livid at this point, and demanded a supervisor.  After re-explaining the situation for what seemed to be the 50th time, she supervisor told me that she would need to get authorization from upper management, and that she would give me a call back tomorrow (today...still no call, but it's early).  She said if they approved it, I would get an email with a shipping label and to send the camera back.  Once they receive the camera, I will be refunded, and can reorder a new camera.  I will be refunded my initial shipping costs, but not the cost I paid to send it in for repair.  So not only am I a month into this, with no working camera, but I spent an hour on the phone, with no ultimate resolution...yet.

Here's the moral of the story.  First, don't send it in for repair, demand a new camera.  Second, go through Amazon, and avoid Kodak's customer service at all cost.  Third, don't buy this camera.  The 1080p mode is nigh-useless (it zooms the frame in, narrowing the viewing angle and shooting width, thereby giving you a clearer picture...but much smaller and more narrow), the internal mic is garbage, and more likely than not, you're going to have a sensor problem (look in the forum below or google ""Zi8 vertical lines.""  You'll see many people with the same problem I had) that isn't going to get fixed for you.  I don't mind buying an SD card, but when you factor in an external mic, tripod (the electronic image stabilization is also useless), and the headache of actually getting a working product, you're going to spend upwards of $300 and have a heart attack.  At this point, I will be taking my refund and running.  I will never buy a Kodak product again.  You send me a defective product, make me pay for the return costs for repair, DO NOT REPAIR THE ISSUE, and then try to tell me that I cant exchange it or get a refund...even though it's covered in the money-back warranty?  I don't think so.  Never again.  All that potential, and this camera is a cheaply made bust.

I think I'm going to take my money, buy off Amazon, and get the Flip MinoHD 2nd Generation.  I have an Ultra HD and it's great, but bulky.  Only would like a mino for the portability.  I would have loved for the Zi8 to work.  External mic, expandable storage, 7209/60fps (this was the feature I was most jazzed about since it offers a much smoother video in ""action"" shots.  Too bad this was the very thing that was defective...twice), thin, sleek design, large screen...almost the perfect camcorder.  But as it stands, the issues with this camera far outweigh the benefits.  I would prefer something more versatile than the Flip line of cameras, but it's looking like thats a pipe-dream at this point.

But it's always best if each battery charges individually. That way the battery is neither over or under charged. You may have noticed how many flashlights and electronic items now use 3 AAA batteries. This is great for the battery company, as they cost the same as AAs but have less than half the power. It also makes it hard for you to use re-chargeable batteries because you must usually charge in pairs.

This charger charges each battery individually, giving you maximum charge and longer battery life. It also does a pretty good job of saving old batteries that other chargers say are bad. There are other chargers that do this, but many are complicated to use, and nearly all are $40 and up. It will also charge eight batteries at once, which is great for 'topping off' your re-chargeable batteries.

I've had it several months now, and use it with batteries from my camera and flashlights, which all get heavy use. Each battery has it's own charging display, which shows level of charge and you can mix AA and AAA in any way you want. And since it has a 12 volt input you can plug it into the cigarette lighter in your car [cord included!] and charge while on the go.

Hint: if you want your batteries to charge a little slower so they don't get as warm [better for battery life]and you are charging four or less, put them all on the same side of the charger.

The only negative, and it's a very minor one, is that there is no on/off switch, so I feel obligated to unplug it every time.

One note:  There are many web sites out there telling you how to upgrade your disk.  Many of them recommend one program or another to copy your old disk to the new one.  Here is my suggestion which does not require a 3rd-party program:  Put your new disk in a USB-to-SATA adaptor case (you will need that anyway; they are cheap!) and plug it in.  Press Command-R when you boot to go to Recovery Options.  Tell it to install a new version of OS-X on the new disk.  After you install it and boot from the new disk, use the Mac Migration Assistant to migrate your data from the old disk to the new.  Voila!  You are done.  Very easy, plus you have a brand new install of OS-X.  (Note:  Office 2011 required me to enter the key again.  A few other things will required me to enter the password again [Dropbox maybe?].

Pros
- Great bang for your hard earned bucks
- Comes with extras (L shape adapter, and Velcro Straps (3))
- Durable materials, made to last.
- The Mesh-like coating on the cable makes it easy to move around, seems to glide over most surfaces but durable and stylish.
- Easy to grip rubber droplet on each end

Cons
-None

Suggestions
- Would like to see TV run different color lines, for those who like the color/pattern of the cable.
- If they want to include extras, how about wall anchors, such as these.

Simple, an individual who is looking for more USB 3.0 ports for multiple devices.

Quality: This is a solid unit with excellent build quality all around, the top plate is machined aluminum and the bottom and sides are plastic.
There are no rough edges on the exterior of the unit. The USB ports worked perfectly and they provide a secure connection for the cable and device connection when in use. There is a blue LED that lights up when the unit is powered on indicating the USB ports are active and can be used. The Hub comes with all the hardware to connect the unit (1 USB female to female cable) (one power cable). The speeds seem to be on par with 3.0 specs.

This is a very stylish looking hub and it goes well with my silver aluminum monitor stand and headphone speaker stand on my desk.

The one caveat and reason for 4 stars is that when connecting a device to the Hub there is a delay in time until it is recognized by the computer up to 20 seconds. Second, minor issue i encountered was trying to charge my headphones. When I plugged them in it repeatedly played the notification sound of a new connected device on the computer which did not stop. I had to unplug them and plug them directly into the USB port on my desktop which made the notification sound one time and stopped. So there is some sort of fault in the hub in this situation.

Cable length may be limited by signal strength, so that's somewhat of a nit. But the driver software is hit-or-miss on a power up or reboot. Sometimes the New Hardware Wizard jumps in before POV loads (this is on XP). In that case the Wizard must be canceled and the unit must then be unplugged for a few moments. Plugging it back in usually causes POV to recognize it correctly. This is inconvenient but by no means a show-stopper. Works seamlessly with Skype, which is my primary use. It's also acceptable for recording video, although you may need to do some tweaking with Windows Movie Maker (or equiv.) to get the audio and video to line up.

The image quality is acceptable, but the utilities included in the POV package make up for any lack there. The snapshot and power buttons on the camera itself are also quite handy.

They sent a prepaid label to send my camera to their store and was able to get it off. Turns out the ring was defective and the grooves went too far in a way where they were stuck. After removing the ring, they sent me a new one that they checked and made sure it worked, and even gave me a free cover cap to protect my camera body.

I really want to say thank you so much for all of your help! I don't know many companies that would have done this for their customers.

OMGG!! I AM FREAKING OUT!! I JUST put this ring on my Nikon D5300 and it is STUCK to the camera body. YES i removed the lens first. YES I am turning it clockwise. When I turn it all the way clockwise, it seems one part of the ring is stuck and the other part can be raise. WHAT DO I DO??!! HELP!!!

I am now contacting customer support and I was able to have then verbally say on the phone they will send me a label for my camera to ship in so they can take a look at it in person. I am relieved that they aren't making me pay for any of this extra work that needs to be done on my camera, but this is an absolute nightmare as my camera lens and mirror should never be exposed to air like this.

But...

To make this work you will need:
* Windows Media Center (free with Windows 7, not sure if it will be included in Windows 8) to decode protected content (and where Time Warner Cable is concerned, that's pretty much all of the HD programming that they broadcast). Mythbuntu can't do it.
* a video card that:
** outputs HDMI (Win 7 will not allow you to watch protected content over DVI-D)
** supports HDPC
* an HDMI cable
* and finally, a TV can accept an HDMI signal

More than likely, you will also need a Tuning Adapter from your cable company.

The Tuning Adapter is in addition to the Cable Card you will also need from your company.

Both the Tuning Adapter and the Cable Card need to be authorized, but you may get lucky and only have to pair the Cable Card to get everything working.

With all of that and everything set up:
* Windows 7 will occasionally lose it mind and thinks that the Cable Card needs to be reconfigured. It doesn't, just re-boot your PC.
* The Tuning Adapter will occasionally lose its mind and refuse to tune to the requested channel. Disconnect the USB cable, power cycle the Tuning Adapter, wait 3 minutes, plug in the USB cable, and you should be good to go.

If you did not understand much of what I just wrote, save yourself a ton of trouble and do not buy this product. Or find a geeky friend and beg for help. Buy him (or her) a case of beer or something. He or she will earn it.

If you understood what I wrote, you will have fun with this product. Be sure and log into the tuner's web page (accessible from the SD Configuration Utility) and copy the log file after you get everything set up and working properly. Save the log file somewhere, it will be invaluable when things start to go wrong, and you need to know what things look like when the box is behaving properly.

BTW, I am glad Silicon Dust decided to drop the price of the product.

Also, the tuner is a lot smaller than you might think it is.","Works well, but not for the faint of heart.",1341187200,

The first use was when I moved to Europe. When I plugged it in, the blue light came on so I started to use it. My external hard drive would not power on. After thinking the airlines destroyed my drive and looking for how to file a claim, I tried my second drive with the same outcome. As I looked over the strip I found there were two switches, on/off and the breaker. Needless to say, one was off.

My only other gripe with this is the plug layout and only two USB ports. I have smaller power strips with more USB ports, and the layout can cause problems of you have side-cord plugs.

Otherwise, this meets all my expectations and then some. I use this while travelling with a universal adapter (the wall plug is US). I have also used this on both 110V/60Hz and 240V/50Hz. Made it on over a dozen trips to a half dozen different countries and not a single issue (other than my two switch fiasco). I recommend this for travellers with electronics with different plugs.

First off I have to say it has the quality feel I get from most Olympus products and is up to the flagship appearance.  I expect that its guts are so solid that it can't readily be made for less. I doubt Oly gets a big juicy profit from this item actually.  Now it may not be known but the removable cover to camera contacts has a light magnetic strip so it won't easily get loose.  The plastic cover of the pins on the grip has to be stored somewhere but that is less of a problem in practice.  I mean one has to keep the lens caps somewhere too, right?  Thing is that it should be easy to get hold of these items from the big vendors and I hope that Oly knows that.  So far it is not so easy to get such as the hot shoe cover....but that is not critical and substituable using the BS-1 by Nikon.  Nikon has its little goodies out there readily and Olympus may get the idea one day..  I consider this a useful adjunct.  Since I have the AC-1 adapter, and company tech says it works on the EM-1 I am able to power via AC while installing the multiple firmware upgrades that seem to be coming along.  I am happy.  I have some ED lenses which I will try on it.  Base rocks some I think, wonder why...guess it is the handle grip design that needs a curvy front.  So do I buy an Arca Swiss plate for it with grip. I think not.  Been there and want to add no more girth to the camera with grip.  Still handlable vs the big mirror and pentaprism lot....aloha gs
Update as of 8/30/2016:  Hard to not see it is an integral to the camera.  I did sort of sacrifice the custom quick release plate that I had on the E M1 and now use it without a plate or with a less satisfactory one, but it is worth that bit.  It feels like a real part of the camera and not an accessory. I find it aids in hand holding and balance.  Gives a couple more buttons to customise if so desired, and of course the spare battery part.  It is as good in build as the basic camera, and the price is not obscene for the value...if one wants assurance that the functions in fact do function and are as water resistant as the company claims...I hope not to put it to an extreme weather test, but feel good about the weather part.

Inexpensiveish, for a wireless mouse.
I cannot use another mouse that doesn't have side-scrolling abilities. Seriously side-scrolling rocks.
There is little to no resistance when spinning the mouse wheel, this may help in FPS's or when scrolling through large documents.
Battery life is considerably long.
Good mouse for palm grip.
Wireless dongle can easily be stored inside of the mouse.
Functions with one battery instead of the recommended two.

Cons:
After a few months of use the mouse wheel is somewhat titled to the left side due to me side scrolling a lot, not really noticeable and there isn't a perceived difference in performance.
The lid that encloses the battery compartment is slightly loosened after months of use making the mouse feel somewhat flimsy.
The bottom is great at attracting dust.
The side of the mouse's different rubber grip can tract dust and oil.

My wife and I wanted to try putting some cameras around our house to see if we liked having them for security or thought it was too creepy having cameras. ALL you have to do is plug them into the wall, install the app on your phone, and follow the instructions to add a camera. Now my phone doesn't have an SD card, so I could not figure out how to get it to save pictures, and I can't figure out the email alert thing, but that's probably my issue, not the software's. You can set it up to notify your phone if it detects motion, and then look in the app and take pictures, which will save to you phone. And supposedly you can set it up to do that automatically, but I can't figure it out.

I ended up using the ispyconnect software on my PC to record images and video when the motion sensor is tripped and it works like a charm. So if you bought this camera and are having trouble with the manufacturer's software, you might look into ispyconnect.

It fails to do what it is supposed to do and the design is so marginal that if it ever did manage to work it probably wouldn't continue doing so for long. Story: I needed a new eSATA case to replace another which had developed a noisy (unreplaceable) fan after running 24X7 for a couple of years with a 750gB WD SATA drive in it. This case looked like it would be fine since it seemed identical to a Rosewill enclosure I've had for a year. Indeed the metal stampings are the same, the plastic is the same, the fan is the same so I can justify my confusion. The little PC boards in the two devices is different and the power supplies are different. The new one was able to operate as a USB device with the old 750gB SATA drive but entirely failed as an eSATA device (I tried on three computers to make sure); this is odd since all a successful eSATA enclosure needs to do is pass through the SATA signals and provide some power but that is the way it worked out. Speaking of power, the Sabrent enclosure comes with a wimpy feather-weight 12V power supply rated at 2A but I really doubt that it is capable of half that since it had a hard time spinning up the HD and since the enclosure derives the 5V with an analog regulator run from the 12V line the spin-up current was even more reduced. The old Rosewill came with a 12V/5V PS rated at 2A on each line and it feels heavy enough to actually live up to the claims.

I won't even bother to send this thing back since I've wasted far too much time with it already. Actually, I should probably put it on a shelf to sneer at occasionally and to teach myself some humility. Just because something new seems to be identical to something old which is good you can't assume that it is.

PROS: fairly sturdy
  works in a half-assed way as a USB enclosure
  has two blue LEDs which can light up a largish room at night in case you want a nightlight

CONS: sturdy is useless in a device which doesn't work properly. If you want sturdy then buy a brick -- it won't work as an eSATA device either but at least it is cheap and you won't waste
hours mucking about with it
  questionable design and manufacture of the PC board
  underpowered power supply

This would be a zero-star review if such a thing were possible on Amazon

FOLLOWUP: I had a chance to actually dig into the guts of this unit today as I tried to resurrect it as a USB-only enclosure for an old 400gB IDE drive. After fixing a loose screw which was causing a bad grounding situation, two potentially-bad solder joints, one definitely-bad solder joint, and a badly-crimped IDE power cable the unit got far enough for me to at least start testing it. The 5V sub-regulator may actually be a switching supply since there is an inductor next to the chip. The manufacture of the circuit board was shoddy. Technicians will know what I mean when I say that they hadn't even bothered to properly wash the board at the end of the line and it was coated with a spotty film of partly-dissolved flux. With luck the purchase won't be a total loss. Of course since it was bought for eSATA use that small (potential) victory in no way makes it a good purchase. Still no idea what the bizarre red/blue lights are supposed to be indicating but they sure are bright.","DON""T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT",1297382400,

There is no ventilation anywhere within the cabinet, and I have an Xbox 360, cable box, receiver, and modem/router all running within the confined space.  I noticed upon playing Xbox that the temps inside the cabinet skyrocketed, to the point of red rings and equipment overheating and acting funny.  Well, not even 6 months after purchasing the console, the Xbox fried, so I knew I had to add some sort of cooling product to alleviate the problem or else I would fry my new Xbox in another 6 months.  Enter this product from [...].

 The product is exactly what I needed.  Using a jigsaw, I cut out the opening in the back panel of the entertainment stand (the thin wood that covers the back... this would be a tough install on a solid thick backing).  One tip I learned is that you have to cut out a rectangle a little smaller than the supplied panel cover.  I tried to just cut the circles out for the fans, but this made it way too hard to install easily.  I went back and cut the full rectangle shape out and voila, went together as easily as everyone else's reviews said.

  It took me about an hour to put together and cleanup.  I turned on the Xbox, receiver, cable box and modem and played continously for 2 hours.  Normally, the Xbox would sound like a 747 taking off at this point, but no, it was very quiet.  I opened the glass doors to feel inside.  What normally felt like an oven (no joke, probably usually 120 degrees plus) was now very comfortable and only felt slightly warmer than room temp.  This thing works!  In addition, it is truly silent.  I just cannot hear it. The Xbox is way louder than the fans, even when the xbox is running low speed.  In all, these work as advertised and aren't terribly difficult to install for anyone handy with some power tools.  It will certainly cool your components when the furniture design is a dud to begin with.  It does seem pricey, but I do believe it will lengthen the life of my components.",Works like a charm,1259020800,

* It performs well.  It is very smooth, responsive, and precise.
* It is not shaped like a cylinder, so it won't roll off a surface when you set it down.
* It has a comfortable weight and thickness.
* It helps reduce (but not eliminate) finger prints on a tablet screen.

I previously used a Boxwave stylus with my iPad, but I now prefer the AluPen.  Although the tip of the AluPen is slightly broader than the BoxWave stylus, the AluPen actually delivers a more precise writing experience with my iPad.

I bought various note-taking apps (e.g. Penultimate, Note Taker HD) for my iPad.  Writing notes with my finger tips didn't work well, and my BoxWave stylus ""skipped"" too many times to make it a practical choice for taking notes during meetings.

The Deluxe is my experience with an Asus board, and I can see why the brand claims so many loyalists. There are many smart choices in the package. For example, the vertical M.2 bracket will help keep the SSD cool versus the flat orientation of other makes ;  a little touch that contrasts to the thrown together feel of some other X99 set ups. And most important of all, so far everything has been stable, functional, and it overclocks like a champ.

Of late, a number of municipalities within my FSDO are enacting ordinances that prohibit (recreational) sUAS operations sans prior ATC clearance. Yes, even if one is within Class G, and under 400' AGL. Sadly, these bureaucrats fail to acknowledge the fact that the FAA maintains the sole and exclusive authority to regulate the NAS. Now, a simple flash the 550L deters those near-harassing, intra-flight inquiries by LEO.
I deliberately sought out the 550L for the sole purpose of operating my sUAS fleet within 5-miles of controlled airspace (caveat: no flights occur without prior ATC clearance, as with maintaining all flights under 400' AGL. Now who sounds like a bureaucrat?).
For my specific use, this is an amazing transceiver. There was, however, a slight learning curve pre-programming frequencies. Fortunately, my CFI has experience with the 550 and walked me through the process.
I have yet to experience a scenario where maximum (speaker) volume was warranted. In one case, I was standing 20' from a major freeway, and 4.72 miles from the airport, and was summarily impressed with the 550L's performance. Coincidentally, I am seriously contemplating the optional (Yaesu) Vertex speaker microphone. This particular decision in no way negates the superb clarity of the radio.
I also appreciate the included AA battery tray, which is always stocked with Panasonic Eneloops, and readily available in my bag. I am of the opinion that two battery sources are better than one.
FAA-compliant sUAS flights are a must for me, and the 550L is a necessary arrow in my quiver. Are there other options? Sure. I, however, have no regrets with my purchase. None.

No matter how good this laptop is, it still only has a 14"" screen. With the smaller single screen, I estimate I can be about 70% as effective as I can while working at home. This AOC screen allows me to take *some* of the benefits of a big desk setup with me on the road. I don't carry this for meetings, conferences, or for using at the coffee shop or on the train! But I DO take it when I'm likely to be in the same hotel for a few days, or abroad for a few weeks. It helps me set up a remote office without a big productivity hit.

Pros:
Simple USB-only hookup
can work off laptop batteries, which drain faster, but still no plug is required
I plugged it into Windows 7...it found its own drivers, then just worked
Light
nice built-in stand
easy for portrait or landscape
same resolution as my laptop
For sales guys, or people making presentations, it's easy to point one screen at the customer, and the laptop at you.
I plugged a single plug into a single USB 2.0 port, and that worked (no second USB plug needed for power.)
Easy to share

Cons:
thick
not protected for travel, you'll need to get a bag or some container, or fit it into your existing briefcase
I don't like the location of the USB port, which is hiding in the slot where the stand retracts. You need to remove the wire to fold in the stand.

Some of the ways I use two screens to be more productive:
1) I can have email on one window, and a browser on the other, when I click news links in newsletters, it opens a browser and loads the page while I can still continue reading the newsletter. This way, I'm not waiting for web pages to load, I only look at them after they are ready.
2) I can be writing one document while viewing source information on the other screen instead of needing to flip back and forth.
3) Multitasking, such as viewing a video while managing files or cleaning up an inbox.
4) I put one in portrait to view a full paper page of a document, instead of a partial page.
5) There are many more little ways two screens helps. It ends up saving a few seconds at a time...but it does it over and over, ALL DAY. It adds up. I put two screens on the desks of all my staff, so they can work better and the response is universal: Day 1: ""I don't really need 2 screens, I work fine with one."" Day 3: ""I see what you mean, there are a few things I can do faster."" Day 30: ""I will NEVER go back to working with one screen on a regular basis.""",Great Way To Add Screen Real Estate On The Road,1325116800,
2405696,0,40,True,"09 9, 2012",A3CJNZ7XJU11T2,B0068ALVAO,,shungoku,"I had initially purchased the DIR-857 right at launch to replace my aging DGL-4500 gaming router. The DGL-4500 is a champ but the wireless range is awful for my 3600 sq ft home, so I decided to give the new top tier dlink router a try. Installation was somewhat clunky due to known issues, but a firmware update resolved the majority of the problems. After 24 hours, I was impressed with the wired and wireless speeds, functionality and of course, incredible wireless range. Sadly, a constant issue came up that couldn't be resolved - both wired and wireless devices would intermittently lose connection for a matter of minutes.

Unfortunately, my family started complaining that they couldn't get online right away, that it would take 15 minutes before they had a connection. I shrugged it off as user error at first as I extensively use my PC for work and would have noticed if their was a connection drop (my VPN would have died and alerted me). Then when browsing mail from my iPhone late at night, I was getting no internet access. I was connected to the network, there was just no internet access. This happened again and again and I soon found it was not only intermittent, but also random - it wouldn't affect all devices at once, just some. This made it quite clear that it was not user error and my family was indeed having issues.

I had the router set up correctly, practically identical to my DGL-4500 setup. I first tried the dlink forum where they had me try all the basics such as reserving  DHCP for listed devices and practically disable every feature to find the culprit. I tried everything and it got to the point where they wanted me to try asking my neighbors if I could hook my router up to their setup for 24 to 48 hours to see if they had the issue. This was the end of the line for me as I felt the request was completely unacceptable given the price tag of the router. In the end the forum blamed the issue on my modem as it doubles as both a cable and phone modem, despite the fact I had no issues with previous dlink routers and my ISP noted the accusation was absurd.

Given the headache and price tag, I opted to return the router for a refund until dlink fixed the issue with a firmware update. The issues certainly could have been due to a defective unit, so I've decided to give the router a shot again. The awful wireless range with my DGL-4500 has become an annoyance again, so I've purchased the DIR-857 again in hopes everything goes smoothly. I will update this review with my final findings once the router is up and running.

UPDATE:

Got the new unit and was up and running in a matter of minutes. Everything was solid for 24 hours; absolutely no issues. Then, unfortunately, the connection issues started again. I've done numerous checking and it's the same issue - the DHCP server fails to maintain or assign IP's properly. I've reserved my mac address and IP using the reservation options, and even tried using static IPs. Despite all efforts to fix the issue, I'm stuck rebooting the router 2-3 times daily to resolve the issue. I'm debating calling support, but at this time I strongly caution buyers to stay far away from this unit.","Amazing router, when it works",1347148800,

Out of the box they do look somewhat flimsy but they do work, however with one caveat. I did have to use a rubberband underneath the wrench to give it enough grip to pull the two items apart. What the wrench is really giving you is just the leverage needed with more equal pressure around the entire filter or adapter. Trying to use your hands doesn't give nearly enough leverage and the point of your hand impact on the filter actually makes them stick worse.

The problem is twofold, 1st the method used for tightening them is not functional and 2nd the plastic S's used to retain the straps broke under what I would call low-medium strain. Normally in strap systems the loose end is pulled in its natural direction (as in down on a set of backpack straps while wearing it). This system does not do that. The first S at the connection to the TV will work that way but will not hold the strap tight. Wobbling the TV loosens it right up. The second S located mid way between the ends will not allow pulling at all. On the left side I tried to first gather the tension on the first S and collect it up by pulling the loose end after the second S. The plastic S broke instantly. I did not even attempt it on the right side. I simply removed the cheap plastic S and tied both off. Not perfect but it is at least as reliable as the original S.

It was cheap, effective storage for the price, except you get less than what you bought. This is always the case with hard disks, and if you are expecting a full terabyte of storage, and worked out a floor plan for how those partitions would fit in a terabyte's worth of space, you'll be sorely disappointed -- Go with a 1.1 TB drive instead so you're sure to be a little bit over what you need.

The performance may be lacking for some, but if you keep very good care of your system, then you won't notice anything worse than what your OEM gave when you first received your machine, provided it's a disk drive.

Some tips to boost performance and prevent data loss through all means:
- Don't install more than you need to do what you want
- Starting fresh is always better, so re-install your OS or upgrade whenever specifications allow it
- Keep your disk drive defragmented, always -- There's even software that resolves data fragmentation on-the-fly.
- Use a good, light antivirus or anti-malware suite with antivirus built-in
- Always run your browser through a sandbox, either that you antimalware suite provides or through a dedicated sandboxing software (Not a virtual machine -- There is a difference)
- Invest some time in software to control your browsing environment and lock down your browser. Anything that NoScript supports is a good start.
- Most of all, have a storage plan. Since this is your drive, you have the power to map out partitions within certain limits; Four base partitions, with the capacity to add more through extended partitions. Helps to know your way around a Linux distro and anything using parted as a backend, like GParted or KParted (depending on desktop environment, may be different from those mentioned).",Great drive for the price... so far.,1392940800,

 I purchased this camera for use on a quadcopter as a cheap alternative to using an expensive GoPro Hero3. I can not confirm that this is a genuine SJ4000 camera because there is no SJCAM labels or logo on the box or camera but with that said my first impressions are good, this camera comes with all sorts of attachments that are compatible with GoPro mounting brackets. The housing of course is not cross compatible as the buttons are in different places.

This camera is much lighter than a GoPro but it is also a little bit thicker so it may not fit in open or closed frame camera mounts made for the GoPro. It comes with a small but usable 1.5"" built in screen and internal speaker for viewing back videos and photos. There are a number of settings in the camera menu such as resolution, quality, exposure, HDR and manual ISO to fine tune the image to your needs. The recorded video is of good quality with sharp detail while providing a Field of View close to what the GoPro has and playback is seamless with no dropped frames at 1080P, the color rendering and exposure are not as good as the GoPro but acceptable for a $51 camera.

Where this camera shows its weakness is when it is pointed towards the sun, the lens makeup is obviously of poor quality as it washes out with sun flare but once again it is still acceptable but nowhere near the pro quality of the GoPro lens. Still images are decent but the exposure timing is low when used indoors so it can be expected that this camera will only perform well in brightly lit settings. The camera has settings for a dash cam where when plugged into a key controlled power outlet the camera will turn on and off when the car is used and record video files at 3, 5 and 10 minute blocks and once the internal (32GB max) card is full it will cycle back over the oldest recordings. There is also a motion setting to trigger recording when the camera senses motion within its FoV.

This camera while it looks and pretends to be a GoPro replacement will do a fine job if you are looking for a ""No frills"" low priced camera but if you are looking for pro quality color and exposure then you would be better looking elsewhere.

I did have an issue with the waterproof case where the C-clip washer holding one of the buttons in place came off while I was using it under water and it started to leak as the air inside wanted to push the button out. I had to hold the button in place until I was able to get out of the water. The camera did not get damaged but it did get wet. Applying some type of retaining compound on the clip should keep it from coming off so keep that in mind.

Pros:

Clear sharp video
Built in screen and speaker
Light weight (60 grams vs 74 grams for GoPro Hero3)
Comes with lots of mounting accessories that are compatible with GoPro mounts
Easy to understand menus
Can be used as a dedicated dash cam

Cons:

Poor quality lens has very strong lens flare when pointed towards sun causing color washout
Thicker than GoPro so it may not fit in open or closed mounts made for the GoPro
Low sensor sensitivity so it will not perform as well as GoPro in low light conditions
Color and Exposure control not as good as the GoPro
Waterproof case can leak if retaining c-clip comes off any of the buttons.

Depending on your area, it might be fine, or a complete failure. It works well for half the channels in my area, and so I am satisfied. I actually had to reduce the amount of signal coming from the unit with a 6dB  attenuator as it was a bit too much for my TVs.

4799968,1,2,True,"04 16, 2015",AMVXR3NPL0GWX,B00PGTOX26,,Patrick Perdu,"I have been using Yongnuo 560-II and 560-III for quite some time for their power and simplicity of use in the studio.
The -II I used with YN603 and procured a pair of -III when I needed more flash since they feature the 603 receiver.

Last time I needed to expand my pool I came across these YN560-IV and lo and behold not only do they feature the 603 receiver, they also feature the emitter and even better they allow to adjust remotely the power and the zoom of the other -IV but (great surprise!) the -III as well.

(At the same time Yongnuo came up with their YN560-TX which allows for simple remote control of up to six independent groups of 560-III and -IV in a way even simpler than with the -IV. I reviewed it separately.)

Triggering modes:
* Hot-shoe - that's when the flash is on your camera.
* Rx - The flash is triggered remotely by a YN602, YN603, YN560-TX or another YN560-IV
* S1 - Synchro on the first flash it sees - useful if you are using a small manual flash on your camera to trigger your other flashs
* S2 - Synchro on the second flash it sees - great if you are using a TTL flash to trigger your setup. That can be an external TTL flash on your camera (e.g. Canon 580ExII or 430ExII) or your camera popup flash.
* Tx - This mode is not available on the YN560-III, only on the 560-IV reviewed here: the flash controls the other flashs in the room as long as they are on the same channel.

A note about S1, S2 and the optical TTL mode of Canon flashs:
As noted above, S2 is useful for light-triggering a Yongnuo flash from a TTL flash - however this does not work well when using optical control of a remote TTL flash such as the 580ExII or the 430ExII from either a 580ExII mounted on your camera or the popup flash of some of the more recent Canon cameras such as the 7D, 70D or 7DmkII. In that case the master flash communicates with the remote flash using bursts of light that get counted by the S1/S2 synchro mode of the optical manual slaves and they trigger on the TTL measurement burst instead of the actual picture illumination flash.
I could get them to work nonetheless by making sure that only the Canon slave flash(s) could see the master flash and that the YongNuo flashs are set on S2 and also see the Canon slave flashs but not the camera and the master flash - but this gets complicated and is prone to failure. In that case, unless you really need the remote TTL capability, I would go for the YN560-TX or a YN560-IV to control the setup.

In addition, don't give your older YN603 away: they can trigger the 560-TX remotely and they can be controlled by it or by the -IV to trigger any other flash including YN560-II, Canon 580ExII or studio monolight (using a small, inexpensive PC sync cord). Of course these are only manual in that case and cannot be adjusted from the camera position, plus they always fire when the -TX shoots.

I could probably have done as well with just the YN560-TX and additional YN560-III instead of the YN560-IV if these were more expensive but the current going price for the -IV is slightly lower than that of the -III so why bother?
[Edited the same day: I see the -III is now $5 or $6 lower than the -IV. In that case it makes sense to get one or two -IV (for backup) or a 560-TX, and a few -III for the rest.]

As a first test I attached a Brunca mask onto a stand (see the picture somewhere on that page), two -IV with red gels on Justin Clamps ot that same stand facing opposite: one towards the black side of a reflector used as a backdrop and one aimed at a piece of paper jammed in the mask, plus one -III on a stand at camera right, in front of which I held a simple sheet of  white paper as a diffuser. I did not even take a softbox out for that picture.

All in all a few YN560-IV are all you need for strobism in manual, possibly with a YN560-TX and, if you can afford it, a small flash meter.","Full-featured manual flash, perfectly suited to studio strobism on a shoestring",1429142400,

Most drives are just plain pieces of plastic with caps. This one has a nice metal piece that swivels to cover or uncover the USB device. It's nice looking and feels sturdy. In addition, the price is right.

Unfortunately, actually using the drive is rather unpleasant. In my tests, using a USB 2.0 port, it managed an average write speed of about 4.5 MB/sec, when tested on five large (1gb+) files. In what is probably a more realistic test scenario - copying about 700mb of mp3s (about 3-6 MB each) it averaged a speed of about 4MB/sec. I don't think these speeds can possibly be right, so I contacted Kingston and am awaiting a reply from their support.

There is an executable that comes preinstalled on the drive - ""urDrive"" that is, from what I've seen, completely useless. If I were rating based on that, the program would get one star, since all it is is an attempt to get you to install Norton bloatware and buy random PopCap games. It certainly doesn't add any value, but it is easy enough to delete.

They arrived today and although they had no instructions you will find instructions on the internet and the process is very simple. Grip the old pads firmly and they will come off quite easily, they are held on by 8 small tabs going around the earpiece. Make a note on how the inner screen fits, it will help later. After removing the old pad I cleaned each headphone with a small paintbrush.

The new pad has two parts, the screen which fits in at an angle with a glue strip (peel off the paper). A notch tells you how to orient the screen, it goes on very easily. After fitting the screen fit the piece with the pad and use a fingernail or a small flat head screwdriver (or plastic spludger) to pop the outer rim of the pads under the 8 tabs. You're Done!

Great features: Supports Active Directory authentication for connection to a Windows domain, built in DLNA media server, built in iTunes server. I particularly like the ability to *easily* add a drive and change RAID types -- with some obvious limitations of course (e.g., you're not going to be able to go from RAID-0 to -1 non-destructively).

Backup: You can schedule or do on demand backups to a drive attached via one of the USB ports. You can also schedule backups to an S3 account at Amazon (very convenient for an offsite backup).

The only (minor) complaints I have, and they're by no means deal breakers (I'm even hesitant to call them ""complaints""):

(1)It's not a screwless design.

Drives are screwed into the rails. This really isn't a big deal to me as I won't be changing drives too frequently, but I understand this may be cumbersome for some.

(2) File permissions can be a little wonky with the Active Directory integration.

When you create a new share, you have to remember to check off the box giving ""Everyone"" Full Access if you plan to change ownership from ""root"" inside Windows. If you don't, even if you add your domain user accounts or groups via the Synology web interface, you won't be able to change ownership inside Windows without getting an ""Access Denied"" error. I also encountered this error trying to add certain permissions. This could purely be operator error, but after trying a number of different combinations, I decided the best way is to check the box off giving Everyone access when creating the share. Then go into Windows, change ownership, set the permissions as you like, and finally remove ""Everyone"" from the permissions inside both the Synology interface and Windows. Realistically, the way it's supposed to work is that for a user to have access, he must have access both in the Synology web interface AND the AD. In theory, that should allow you to have Everyone with Full Access without ill effect, but I prefer removing it.

Fortunately, if you do forget to do this, you don't have to start over. A workaround is to create a new share (remembering to check that Everyone/full access option), then use the web interface to move the data from the old directory to the new share directory you created. You can then delete the original shared directory and rename the new one to whatever you like.

Assuming this is not the intended operation, I'm sure this could be changed in a future firmware release. Either way, it's little more than a minor nuisance since there are workarounds. One note: this applies to system-created shares for the media server too (/video, /music, /photo). If you want to have one of your AD users own those shares too, just remember to create the directory shares manually and setting permissions & ownership the way you want before activating the media server. With the exception of the /photo share, permissions will remain (the /photo directory is reserved/protected from certain changes). Again, here, if you did already activate the media server and had the system create the folders, you're not out of luck. You can turn the server off, rename or delete the shares, and recreate them yourself before reactivating the server.

Howard,"Although relatively inexpensive, this is a great lens that outperforms the typical kit lenses that come bundled with a camera. Admittedly this lens has an advantage over the typically kit lenses, as this is a fixed focal length (AKA prime) lens as opposed to a zoom lens. Prime lenses have their limitations, in that the only way to ""zoom"" in or out is to move either the photographer or the subject.

Once you know and adjust to framing your shots with a prime lens, you can take some really great shots. For the price, this is some great glass. Pictures are sharp and colors are vivid. With a max aperture of f/1.8, the lens is also very capable for low-light photography. Its aperture range also allows great control over a picture's depth of field.

I've also used the lens for dark-sky photography with good results. At 50mm you get a much smaller shot than with a wide angle, but the quality if good. The longer focal length also means you have to use a shorter exposure time to prevent star trails, but with the wide aperture you don't need an overly long exposure.

In summary, this is a great lens that I use often. If it were lost or damaged, I would not hesitant to immediately buy it again from the same vendor.","Great lens for a great price, much better than bundled kit lenses",1425686400,

First off, while connected using the A6210, it shows in my task try icon that my connection is 802.11n and not 802.11ac.  My router, NETGEAR R6300v2 is 802.11ac capable and I have another device that connects and shows an 802.11ac connection. Additionally, the NETGEAR A6210 Genie software shows that my 5 GHz network is AC capable.  In conversation with Netgear support, they have indicated that this is a limitation of Windows 7.  My link rate is fairly consistently 866.5 Mbps and my download rates have gone up significantly also when compared to my internal Wi-Fi adapter that was only 2.4 GHz capable.  Where I would get about  50 Mbps download speeds, I am now consistently above 80 Mpbs.  The connection is rock solid and I have had no issues otherwise with the performance of this device.

Next, when using the NETGEAR genie software that came with the A6210, under the section ""Other"", the ""Software Update"" button ""Check"", I receive an error message, ""ERROR: Could not connect to the NETGEAR server. Please check your Internet connection."" Clearly my Internet connection is working, so there must be an error in either the server it is looking for or the server is unavailable.  Netgear did not respond to this issue when I brought it up.

The last issue I have noticed is, when selecting the ""Get Diagnostics Info:, Get Info"" feature, a separate window pops up, with a progress bar and this updates to 75% where it does not progress any further regardless of how long you wait for it to continue. From this pop up window, the only option available is ""Exit"" as the ""Save to File"" option is greyed out.  Netgear did not respond to this issue when I brought it up.

All of that having been said, I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software and there is no change to the issues I have noted.  I rated it 4/5 stars simply because it isn't perfect, but it does work very well aside from what I consider the minor issues listed above.  The packaging says requires Windows, to include Windows 7, yet Netgear insists that Windows 7 doesn't support 802.11ac. I am fairly confident that this is a defect in the presentation of the connection as my download speed is consistent with my other device (MacBook Air) that is showing an 802.11ac connection.  Subsequent to installing this device, I have gone back and disabled my internal wireless adapter, though I don't believe that was required.

The last thing worth noting is that my current setup is a large laptop that I have essentially setup as a desktop replacement and I am using the A6210 via a USB 3.0 (powered) hub and using the supplied cradle.  I did this initially as my laptop only has one USB 3.0 port and I have two other devices (external portable hard drive and an external Blu-Ray optical drive) so I had reservations that it would work.  I was happy to discover that it has worked just fine in this configuration.

After looking around for almost a year, and trying different bags out, I decided to go with the Tamrac Evolution 8. It has the right amount of camera storage for my camera, lenses and other miscellaneous things (lens cloths, filters, memory cards, etc).  I also was impressed with the ability to switch it between a backpack and sling pack, although I think I'll leave it in backpack ""mode"" most of the time.  The included rain cover was great too.  But what I most liked was the ability to access the camera from either side of the bag, without having to take the whole bag off to get at it, and you don't have to open up the entire back section of the bag either.  Finally, it has a laptop compartment, which was my final requirement.  All storage areas are well padded, and all of my gear fits great.  The laptop is a different story.

I never had my laptop with me when I was trying out this pack before buying.  I simply checked the size listed on the tags.  The Evolution 8 says it fits most laptops with up to 15.6"" screens.  My laptop is 15.4"", so I thought no problem.  The tags also list the actual laptop dimension limits, including a laptop thickness of 1.5"" (which seems to be the same listed for most other laptop/photo combo backpacks I've seen).  My laptop is about 1 and 5/8 inches at the back where the screen hinge is.  That extra 1/8"" counts, unfortunately.  I can get the laptop in there, but it is very tight, and zipping the compartment shut is difficult. It takes a lot of pulling for about a minute in the right places to get it back out. I just don't feel safe putting my laptop in there.

So check the dimensions of the laptop you intend to carry around in this to make sure it's going to fit.  They really aren't kidding on the dimension limits listed, mostly because the padding is so good in this bag that it doesn't compress much.  Other packs may have more ""play"" in that number, but not the Evolution 8.

Overall this bag is great to carry both photo gear and a laptop, as long as you have a somewhat current laptop that will fit (mine is several years old).  It wears comfortably with it loaded, has plenty of little pockets and other storage for random items, and has flexibility to adapt to different situations with its sling pack options.  I recommend it, as long as you know the laptop will fit nicely.","Great Backpack, But Check Your Laptop Dimensions!",1305849600,

SOME aspects could be improved by a firmware update, but I don't know if the unit was built with that potential.  I'd like it to have better iPod integration, for example, be easier to search by album, artist or title.  The random feature could use some help too, as it seems to always pick the same tunes over and over again.

Bluetooth integration is seamless, and the sound is outstanding.  Tuck the included microphone's cord under the post cover (alongside the window) and put it up on the visor (leave some slack in the cord when you're installing it) and you can speak naturally while on the phone and looking at the road.

  The second thing is to do a push/pull air flow, that was easy. Just use the screws that came with the fans. On the back side put two screws at the top, the bottom and the middle. I just went Home Depot and got longer screws and the next size bigger. They will just screw right in with a little push.
  The third thing is what to do with all of the wires for the fans. I bored a hole with a electrical cone shape boring bit. Picked it up at Home Depot in the electrical dept.

I won't say much of anything about how it pairs with the zoom since my results are favorable and similiar to what all others seem to be be saying: It works exceedingly well!

I'm most excited with the results I'm getting shooting closeup.  This extender is not officially supported with lenses less than 135mm (at their longest focal length), but this can be circumvented by way of extension tube on the 100 L macro.

I've recently taken an interest in bug hunting only to find 1:1 can often be not enough magnification at times, or too close for comfort for your subject.  But using the extension tube along with the extender, I'm able to put a little more distance between myself and the subject for 1:1 shots, or allow myself to get even closer for what I'm estimating to be 1.6x magnification at a new shorter minimum focussing distance.

I am experiencing no sharpness decrease with use of the extender, and it seems the slight chromatic abberation that can be visible paired with the zoom, is even lessened or non existent with the macro prime.  This is probably more a function of the extension tube further ""cropping"" the corners of the image circle with the increase in magnification.

There are a few draw backs with this combo.  The lens/camera is no longer perfectly balanced when mounted on a tripod collar, as the rig becomes back heavy.  Putting the collar on backwards so the collar's foot faces towards the camera seems to help a bit.

Autofocus no longer works paired with my 5D.  But when I'm shooting macro, I'm always using MF anyway so this may not be an issue.  Just calling it out for those that do use AF with macro.  You also lose several stops of precious light due to the extra extension.  I've been offsetting this by use of diffused, off camera flash.

The other drawback is that your percieved depth of field is decreased.  I'm finding the need to stop down around 1-2 extra stops to get the required depth of field.  This is more a function of higher magnification I think, and was not expected when I first started using the combo.  When I was already shooting at f13-f16 natively, the need to stop down further can be tricky when you're trying to balance ISO, shutter speed, diffraction, etc.

I'm really enjoying the additional options I have for macro photography with this extender.  Short of buying the MPE-65, this is a great way to get a bit more magnification/reach without spending too much.",Fantastic for macro with the 100L!  In addition to everything else...,1325808000,

The maximum charging output is less than an LUC V4, the D4 maxing out at 775 mA and about half that while charging 3+, the LUC at 2,000 mA, or 1,000 mA if charging 3+... So, in terms of charging speed, the LUC wins hands down. Also, the wall plug is loose and wobbly on every outlet I've tried it with. My dog walking by the outlet has knocked it out and bent the prongs more than once, which is an issue I never had with my Efest charger. Past that, I like the features on the D4 and hope it can outlast my LUC in terms of durability.

However, be warned, it doesn't work with Linksys WRT54G V8. Not the HSB2's fault, but this router doesn't have a removable antenna, so there is nothing to which the HSB2 can attach.

Earlier WRT54G's apparently DID have a removable antenna, but the V8 doesn't.

I now have the HSB2, extension antenna cable, and Linksys adapter, but need to get a different router in order to use this stuff.

As noted elsewhere, the documentation is useless; read the outside of the box instead.

UPDATE:

I believe this product may be obsolete. I've searched Amazon and two large electronics stores for a wireless G router with removable antenna. I didn't find any. The latest models I found all have fixed antennas.

So, if you happen to have an older router with removable antenna (with a post of appropriate size), this may work fine. Otherwise, find another solution.

If you want a simple, solid, capable wireless access point this is a great buy. Configuration is relatively simple, and the unit has a variety of useful higher end capabilities, including multiple SSIDs and guest networks. Being powered by an included PoE injector means you're not tied to the presence of an electrical outlet when placing it. It's clean design and simple status light allow it to unobtrusively blend into the environment.

I was a little spoiled by the availability of 5GHz and an RF Environment scanner in the AP Pro, unfortunately this has neither. However I haven't really missed either of them in my small apartment. The signal is robust enough that I can get a solid lock sitting in my car across the street.

Ubiquiti has awesome documentation, covering everything from a quick start guide to signal propagation properties.

The Unifi Controller is probably the most annoying part. To make any changes to the AP, or to track usage statistics, the Controller must be running on a computer. When the controller isn't running you can't make changes, nor are statistics being gathered. However the access point can function perfectly fine with no controller running. The lack of product integration with the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter lineup is also a little disappointing, requiring the UniFi Security Gateway for any advanced traffic analysis.

Overall it's a solid product, but I might recommend the AP Pro in noisier environments just for that sweet, sweet 5GHz.","Rock solid, unintrusive, intuitive, and powerful.",1528588800,

While I like the clear, precise sound of the standard Apple bud with mic, they're uncomfortable and can suffer from low volume. While the Creative 630i isn't up the audio quality of a pair of good IEMs, there's a lot to like with these:

1. Comfort. An individual's ear diameter can vary considerably,and the 630i comes with small, medium, and larger size ear pieces.  You can leave these in your ears for hours without discomfort; the soft, rubber-like ear pieces are a definite improvement over hard ear buds.
2. Sound. The Creative 630i, when properly fitted, has a full, balanced sound with adequate treble and a solid bass, although the latter could be more ""quality"" in the low notes. If you're listening to podcasts or spoken word, you can't go wrong; if you're interested in music, these ear buds are accurate and pleasing. Those with more demanding musical requirements might find an IEM more suited to their needs.
3. Life. I've owned both the 630 and 630i, and there's little difference in general build. Repeatedly pulling at the jacks or earbuds will eventually damage your set - that's why you should use them with care. Wrap them up loosely to preserve the cables.
4. Mic. The 630i comes with a mic. You can also use it with an iPod to stop and start the audio. You may not, however, be able to increase or decrease the volume through the integrated cable, depending on the model of your player.
5. Value. These retail for around $40, though it's easy to find these at around $30. It's a fair price, but other ear buds may offer a better value, depending on your needs.

There's a reason why these buds have a five star rating: they sound good, fit nicely, and have a reputation among users and audiophiles. If you don't want the mic function, buy the 630 (not the 630i) and save even more.",A top pick,1326758400,

REVIEW: I was looking for an 11""-13"" small laptop or netbook that could web surf, blog, and run MS Office. I also wanted to be able to handle basic, on-the-fly photo editing & design using Adobe CS5. Lastly, I needed something that could run for at least 6 hours on battery and had a full-size keyboard. Going with the Acer Aspire One 722 was a good choice price wise and provided a power efficient option that met my needs while on the road. Hopefully, you find this review helpful.

After testing it without any upgrades for a week, it was way faster than the Atom netbooks I've used in the past and faster than my old 11.6"" Acer AS1410 Core2 Solo from last year. However, I wanted a bit more grunt power and speed. Upgrading the hard drive and memory seemed like a good decision, and it has turned this entry level PC into something on par with most mid-range desktops. Here are the upgrades I made:
* Crucial C300 2.5"" 128GB SATA III Internal Solid State Drive (SSD)
* G.SKILL 4GB 204-Pin DDR3 SO-DIMM DDR3-1333 PC3-10600 Unbuffered Non-ECC

Being that this is a review for the Acer Aspire One 722, it's only fair to give you the PROS and CONS without factoring in the upgrades.

PROS:
* Amazing keyboard - Huge buttons, nice click and very little flex. Buttons are where they should be.
* Dedicated graphics - Video streams via YouTube and Hulu in HD without stuttering. 1366x768 resolution means I can run Photoshop natively. 256MB of dedicated graphics memory, means I can flip through web pages without waiting for it to catch up.
* Battery life - With the original hard drive, I was getting 4.5-5 hours on the ""balanced"" power setting. 7 hours on ""power saver""
* Windows 7 64bit with an AMD C-50 processor
* Brand name - This is my 4th Acer PC. There are a lot of great options out there, but IMHO Acer is the best bang for the buck.
* Charger cord - Something I've grown to appreciate is how compact the charger cord is. It is only one cord, as opposed to the usual two part cord included with most laptops. It's a whopping 8 feet long and comes with a Velcro strip pre-attached to neatly store the coiled cord. The charging block is at the plug-in end. Also, the prongs can be rotated 90 degrees so it doesn't block any more of a powerstrip or outlet than it has too. Nice job!
* Webcam - Very clear webcam. It's only a 0.3 MegaPixel, but when I'm traveling my misses says it's crystal clear on Skype.

CONS:
* Glossy black lid - Not a deal breaker, just a matter of preference. Wish it was matte. I do like the embedded ripple. Kind of groovy.
* BEEP - If you plug-in or unplug the power cord while the netbook is ON, the computer lets out a loud beep - just loud enough to make you flinch. It reminds me of my very first PC from 20 years ago. This can be disabled in Control Panel > Device Manager > click on the ""View"" menu at the top > click ""Show Hidden Devices"" > click the + sign next to ""Non-Plug and Play Devices"" from the list of devices > double click ""Beep"" > go to the ""Driver"" tab > choose ""Disabled"" in the Startup drop down menu.
* No Bluetooth - Using a mini USB Bluetooth adapter to resolve that.
* Trackpad size - You can kind of expect this on a laptop this small. I prefer a wireless mouse anyways. Other than size, the pad feels perfect and is very responsive. The trackpad buttons are the best I've ever used.
* Linux users  - As of 6/14/11, the graphics card, web cam, and wifi drivers are buggy on Linux. I tested Ubuntu 10.04, 11.04, Mint 11 and Joli 1.2 and was experiencing system freezes and resolution issues.

AFTER UPGRADING THE MEMORY AND HARD DRIVE:
* Boot time - Before the upgrade:  1 minute 35 seconds. After the upgrade: 32 seconds.
* Battery life - I get about 5.5-6 hours with the power management setting on ""balanced"". 8+ hours on ""power saver"".
* Photoshop CS5 64bit - Opens in 7 seconds now as opposed to 16 seconds previously.
* Multitasking - I'm able to multitask a couple web pages, streaming music, Outlook, Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Bridge and Camera Raw simultaneously without a prolonged hourglass. That's good enough for me.",Powerful little laptop that can even run Photoshop CS5 64bit,1308182400,

It arrived in two days - Amazon is terrific - and it was fairly easy for us to set up and use, even though neither of us is a tech person. The onscreen menus could be a little more clear, but we took our time and got through the setup procedure fairly quickly. I downloaded the user manual from the Onkyo site and it was a help if we had any difficulty, with more detail than the paper documentation that came with the receiver. We never even looked at the disc that came with it, although that might be just as good, or maybe even the same. We found that the wireless LAN adapter from Onkyo also worked well in spite of some unfavorable reviews. We followed the instructions that came with the adapter and had it connected to her network in about 5 minutes, or less. One reason it worked for us may be that her router is in the same room as the receiver, within about 15 feet. If you have a different situation, your result may not be the same. Fortunately this receiver had the latest firmware, so we didn't have to update it. The receiver replaces an outdated Sony, and my daughter is very happy with the modern features in the Onkyo, and its excellent connectivity and performance.  I am also impressed with it - it seems well built, with a good feature set and a heft that belies its modest price. For the money, I think you'd have a tough time finding a better receiver.",excellent value,1363132800,

Almost two months ago, Amazon put this on special as a ""Today's Deal"" and I ordered one as a gift for my daughter.  She travels quite a bit and I thought that it would come in handy.  After using it a couple of times, she told me how pleased she was with it so I took another look at it and decided to order one for myself at the regular price of $22.

I travel quite a bit for work and I know what it's like to be at the airport with only one power outlet for 20 people.  I know what it's like to go to your hotel room and find only one outlet while having to charge your laptop, phone, iPod, and iPad.  What are you going to do now, cowboy?

I just got back from a trip and was very happy that I had this along.  I carry a battery pack with me so I don't have to worry about finding an outlet in the airport to recharge.  But when I got to my hotel room, I had a half charged phone, iPad, battery pack and laptop.  I pulled out this Belkin SurgePlus outlet and went to the one wall outlet I saw.  Imagine my surprise when the round ""third prong"" of the outlet was at the top.  It's on the bottom for the surge protector so I thought it would be plugged in pointing up.  I noticed a small, rectangle white button on the back.  Press it in and you can rotate the outlet!  Problem solved!  I rotated the plug and now the surge protector was hanging down and all was right with the world again!

I plugged in my laptop into one of the outlets and started charging it.  I grabbed my Apple Lightning cable and plugged it into one of the upper USB outlets and started charging my iPad.  Note that this charger is 2.1A so my iPad went from 50% to 100% in about a half hour.  I plugged my mini-USB cable into the other USB outlet and charged my Android phone up to 100% in even less time.  If you have a 1.0A charger, you will be there forever.  Not with this surge protector.

With this surge protector in my travel bag, I no longer use (but still carry) my Apple or Android charger heads.  I'm very pleased with this unit.","If you travel with electronics, strongly recommend this unit.",1422921600,

The pen was a little confusing to use at first, but fortunately, you can find videos online at the vendor's website.  The best thing is you can print what you're writing in pdf documents along with the recordings too.  It's really easy and you can e-mail to friends too.

The only problem is it seems like the ink runs out quickly.  I now have some of the ink replacements taped into the notebooks so that when I run out again, I will have the ink handy.  The bonus is, even IF you do run out of ink, keep writing.  It's hard to write without ink, but you can still get all the info into the notebook.  You won't see it on the paper, but it will show up in the pdf document as if you had written all the info with ink.

The dot paper is kind of expensive, but the pen came with a small little notebook.  I read somewhere that you can print your own dot paper, but I have not gone through the other notebooks I have purchased, so I do not know how well that will work.  Will try it since a pack of three notebooks cost me about $18 on sale.

I received the unit and made sure that it would do what I intended and within a day I ordered the handle-bar mounting kit and the carrying bag as well.

It clamps to your handle-bar by the use of heavy-duty zip-ties and DeLorme provides a self-stick rubber sheet that you wrap around your handle-bar before attaching the unit. While it is a primitive design, it works flawlessly and I tested it on some rough road before I considered writing a review of the product. It has not slipped at all and the PN-30 is held securely at just the right viewing angle for me.

I would love to see DeLorme modify the mounting kit to make it easier to put the GPS handheld into the bar mount, but, it is so secure the way it is designed, so, I am pretty sure they make it the way they do to prevent the unit from accidently coming loose if you are mountain-biking or riding a rough road like the Pan-Am Highway.",Must HAVE item for any cyclist with a DeLorme handheld GPS,1273363200,

It should go without saying, but I will mention it anyway.  If you open this up and start cutting wires, good luck getting any kind of a warranty.

I purchased several of these to use for powering RC battery chargers.  I have a total of 4, 2 in parallel then each parallel rail being connected in series.  Just using the 12V supply is 16 amps  each for a total of 32 amp per power rail in my setup.  This works out to a total of 64 amps at 12v or 32 amps at 24v.

When I start loading these up heavy (50A @ 12v/ 600 watts) they put out a decent amount of heat, but they keep right up.  The voltage doesn't seem to sag at all.  Then again I'm using a fairly constant load, there's very little surge in my battery chargers.

To optimize for my purposes, I cut the 3.3v & 5.5v leads and tucked them away nicely inside.  I then ran 8ga wire inside the supply and secured it all with zip ties.  I also extended the power-on leads so that I can remotely actuate them from a switch panel.  Even better, the supply will latch on without a load on the 5.5v side unlike many other switching supplies which require a minimum load.  This means when running it on a genny there's no wasted power or extra generated heat.  I added a cap at the point where I connected the two supplies.  As of yet I have seen no issues with them ""fighting"" with each other's clock cycles when run in parallel.

Overall a good supply performing exactly as I had hoped so far.  We'll see how they do after I've owned them a while longer and continue to abuse them with high current loads.",Repurposed for a 12V power supply,1396310400,

Amazon has taken to grouping products that aren't at all the same and putting all the reviews together.  with 1600+ reviews, any significant review is completely lost and, even if you read it, make sure you are looking at the same product.  The TL-SG1008D is a plastic cased 8-port Ethernet switch.  The electronics inside it are not the same as any of the other model switches in this 1600+ reviews so joining them is pointless.

I would give this 5 stars except that it has one problem for me.  This switch uses a 9-volt power supply instead of the standard 2.1mm jack, 12VDC power supply, that virtually every other network product I have uses.  In my network room, I have installed a 15-amp CCTV style 12V power supply to power all my network devices so I don't have a ton of wall-warts.  With this 9v power supply now I can't use my 12v supply and am back to wall warts.

I was willing to risk burning up one of the switches to try it on 12V.  If it has an internal regulator then it shouldn't matter if it gets 9V or 12V as input.  The only problem is, this unit doesn't use the standard 2.1MM plug that most devices, even other than 12V devices, use.  That means my 12V plugs will not work to even try to power this.  I could trash the power supply to get the plug that fits, or spend more hours than it's worth to find a matching plug I can wire up.  Even if I did, I will always have to keep up with a separate plug or power supply for this unit.  I could cut the plug off the power supply and use a 9v regulator in line to get from my 12V supply to these switches but that's another customization because this is non-standard.

Even if you don't have a custom power system like I have, how many times have you had to throw away a device because it got separated from it's power supply and you couldn't find it.  This is a negative for any user of this switch.",Ok switch but non-standard power supply.,1423958400,

The mount that came with the unit was defective, Garmin immediately sent out a new one and have had no troubles at all since.

The GPS is spot on.  Roads etc are very accurate.  Updates are frequent and I just disconnect from mount, take it into the house, connect to my iMac and do all of the updates that way.  Takes about 5 minutes tops.  Map updates are very frequent.

There are 3 things that I really do not like:
1- The icon selection for your vehicle.  I like the arrow(delta shape).  The others are cartoonish
2- I would prefer to have the vehicle position at the tip of the arrow, not in the middle of the icon.  It leads you to believe you have further to go when you end up overshooting the turn
3- I haven't yet figured out how to do this but I like to just point to a spot on the screen and just ""GO"" to that point.  You would think that it would do this but we are still trying figuring this out.

Overall we are very pleased with the unit.  Have taken it out of our car and used it in rentals while on trips.  Works great everywhere.  Just don't forget to take the external power cord (batteries don't last that long).

While it doesn't have a preset color temperature setting, I use Spyder to calibrate all my monitors, and this, my first LED backlit monitor, is a bit different.  I do not use the audio signal from delivered through the HDMI connecter, and wish this monitor had a standard DVI connector, but understand the economic and physical reasons for omitting the DVI (this monitor is very thin).

For a broadcast or editing studio, this monitor would probably not satisfy the professionals, who will argue that they need to see 12 bits per color component (these consumer LCD displays offer about 6 and few can people can resolve more than 256 levels, 7 bits), this is as good as it gets.

I figured this would be a return, since the shipper, perhaps angry at all the stairs he had to climb to deliver the box, dropped it from waist height, on my deck.  Other than the white plastic cover having a slightly lifted corner, I was amazed that the monitor was fine.  Certainly, the rolled up paper ON TOP of the internal ASUS box didn't provide shock absorption.

If the monitor is properly calibrated, there is NO backlight leakage.  Because I use LCD displays for photographic editing.  They come overdriven and set to almost twice the lumins/square cm optimal for looking at photo images (my brightness needed to be set to 40 satisfy the Spyder 3).  If you want to edit, buy a ""Spyder"" and calibrate your monitors. This one didn't require overdriving the blue component, which may have to do with the individual LED illuminating sources, and is as black as my gold standard CRT.",State of the art monitor.,1300838400,

The manufacturer must have listened to all the negative feedback because all of my screws were tight.  This unit did not include the mini tripod so I assume that addition has been discontinued.  There was no user manual included but I easily found it and downloaded it from the Internet. I have no comments on the carry bag since I do not plan on using it anyway. The manufacturer clearly states in the manual that the levels are only to be used as a guide.

Here is their exact quote ""The included bubble level is a guide. The exact level position of the tripod depends on the extension of the legs, the angle of the legs, whether or not the surface the tripod is sitting on is level or not etc. Also, the bubble level is mid-level on the tripod head and slightly off of dead center. Thus, it may read perfectly level with the tripod head pointing in one directly and then read something other than perfectly level during a pan. Also, it is possible for the tripod to be level at the base of the head where the level is but off slightly above or below the level. If it is crucial to the user to have perfect true level, we recommend using a professional separate level at least 6 inches in length or more.""",Sturdy Tripod,1363219200,

I've purchased multiple types of other portable speakers in the past, and these are definitely the best sounding speakers I've had.  Also the battery life is excellent, and I've never ran out of power while using them for hours.  (You also can have them plugged into USB to charge them while they are being used, so if you're using these for connecting to a laptop you can charge them at the same time.)

There are only two cons I can see with these speakers. The first is there is no volume control, only a power on/off switch.  This means that you have to use the volume control on the player to control the volume, which isn't the best option if the volume control is only on the touch screen.  The 2nd con is more of a mistake on my part, which is I have the Zen X-fi2, not the Zen X-fi.  The X-fi2 is a bit larger than the X-fi, so it doesn't fit in the connector slot on the speakers.  So if you have the X-fi2 this is not recommended for you.  (I decided to keep it anyway because the sound quality really is excellent, and Creative didn't make a set for the X-fi2... So my solution was to use an audio extender cable to connect to the speakers, and with this setup I can also use it with any of my other portable devices.)","Excellent sound, but one thing to keep in mind...",1281571200,

Holman,"As another reviewer noted, this hub has a critical flaw: moving the cord even the slightest bit interrupts the flow of data/power, causing other devices to be disconnected. But its actually worse than that. There are four power switches, one for each port -- but you better not dare use them, unless you boot with all your usb devices connected and all power switches on, and leave things that way. Otherwise, pressing any of the power buttons to send power to another device will disconnect devices that are already powered -- in the same manner as if you bumped the power cable. If Sabrent had not included the power switches, this hub might at least be usable for me.

Yet, even if the switches had worked properly, I doubt they would have worked for long. The construction seems extremely cheap. As I took it out of the box, I was reminded of the junk they give away as freebies at the state fair, or the toy surprise that used to come with Crackerjack -- this hub was certainly a surprise.

To be fair: though this is the poorest quality hub Ive ever owned out of probably a dozen, it is also the least expensive.  And as other reviews suggest, it may work for some users. If you don't plan to use the switches and never bump the cable, you might luck out.

But of course, the switches are why I bought it: I was hoping to avoid messing with physically connecting and disconnecting my usb drives, but to select which drives were needed via the switches. I do that quite efficiently on two other computers with two other hubs that also have switches. I took a chance on this one because of its low price, and for what I paid, I won't bother to return it.

Pros:
1) Amazing video (when you can actually see what you shot)
2) Great included accessories and all the aftermarket ones for Go Pro fit the camera.
3) Fantastic price compared to Go Pro
4) Shoots good photos
Cons:
1) The depth of info in the user manual is completely inadequate.  There are an extensive number of settings, none of which have any descriptions in the one page paper that comes with this.
2) Perhaps related to issue 1, this camera deletes video it just shot when you start a new one.  I have a massive, top of the line storage drive on this that provides space for more than 7 hours of video and more than 10,000 videos, but it deletes shot video without rhyme or reason and we have lost some one of a kind moments which is as infuriating as it was heartbreaking.
3) Less important, but the battery life is poor.  We overcame this by buying several inexpensive aftermarket batteries. This fixes this problem.

Bottom line, The hard part is creating the camera, the easy part should be including a decent manual explaining how to use it and what the settings do.  Also, I am not aware of a camera on the planet that deletes what you just shot when you start shooting anew, and for that reason alone I would recommend that people consider other brands.  The only way we can use this camera is to shoot a single video, take it inside, download it to safeguard it, and then head back out. That makes it not useless, but one step removed from useless.

I am willing to change my review and stars if someone can point out a setting that will make this stop deleting videos we just shot.",Could be great but suffers from self-inflicted wounds,1451606400,

I  was thinking of buying a noctua, maybe a cougar. But I needed at least 5 fans to change all fans on my case. This pack was cheap enough, at the price of just 1 noctua fan that I just bought it meanwhile. But oh boy, I think this are staying forever in my case.

The rundown. They move a lot of air, my gpu which was idling at 40C and my cpu at 35 to 40C after some use are now idling at 35C both. The noise is sileeeent, you can see in the pictures my setup, 5 fans, 2 on top, 2 on the front as intake and 1 on the back on a VT-380 DIYPC case.

So far with my setting curve, if the pc is idling its silent. between 1% and 20% power can barely hear it , as soon as they reach 30% I can hear the wind noise inside the case, at 100% Its loud, but mostly because of the wind turbulence inside the case. When idling all I can hear now is the cpu fan from the 212 evo which is the stock fan (gotta replace it with one of this).

Pros: Silent, move a lot of air, Nice colors for a black case, the white is pretty much a nice contrast. Cheap 5 fans for the price of one noctua fan.

Cons: Cables are a bit short and unbraided, they are yellow black and blue, if you can hide them its nice, if not , oh well.  The extra pst conector its nice, its for chaining them each other but in my case is a con , I already have 2 splitters running behind the motherboard and they are mmostly clutter, wish they had a 5 pack for the non pst model.

If you are on a budget and want your system to be cool and quiet for cheap, this is what you are looking for. Just remember, fans will make noice if they are at high rpm, so just keep yuor fans at low rpm while your pc is doing nothing. Dont expect the fans to be silent when they are at max rpm or 50% rpm.  I can barely hear thsi fans when they are between 30 and 40%, below 30% I only hear the humm of the 212 Evo stock fan.

My Cable box feeds the input of a two way splitter. One of the two splitter outputs feeds my main TV, the other output feeds an ORI HD-104 Four Way Splitter, to feed the other four TV's around the house. Audio and video are perfect with this setup.

I needed a 2 way splitter to have on hand as a spare, so I ordered this ORI HDS-102 Two Way Splitter, and tested it by replacing the existing two way splitter.

That's when I ran into a strange problem.

When I turned on the TV connected to the two way splitter, the video was normal, but the audio was intermittently cutting in and out. (The audio and video to the four other TVs was normal).  Through a long process of elimination, I finally determined that the new ORI HDS-102 is NOT compatible with the the ORI HD-104. As soon as I would plug in the 4 way splitter, the audio would start cutting out on the TV connected directly to the two way splitter.. Unplug it, and the audio would return to normal. Even when I unplugged all  the outputs from the 4 way splitter, the audio would cut out when it was connected.

I reinstalled my original 2 way splitter and everything returned to normal.

It's unfortunate, but this is the world of HDMI and HDCP that we live in.",Audio and video are perfect with this setup,1527984000,

I personally would not use these arms for holding my full-size Nikon DSLR....even my light weight D5300 is possibly too much for the arm. (Locking Ring vs. Surface Area on the cold shoe will determine much of this.)

FINAL OPINION :: I am glad to see this works as intended & it does what you would expect & keeps its 'form' once you tighten the locking 'knob'.  It won't hold extreme weights, but for a standard DSLR rig it's perfect.  Well made and agile, these arms do help you customize your gear/rig, I plan to order the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/IMORDEN-11-quot-28cm-Articulating-Magic-Friction-Arm-for-Hot-Shoe-Mounts-Work-with-DSLR-Camera-Rig/dp/B00QTIVL82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">IMORDEN 11""/28cm Articulating Magic Friction Arm for Hot Shoe Mounts Work with DSLR Camera Rig</a>&nbsp;... using it to get my Handy H1 'Mic' away from my AF/Shutter 'noise'.

They could do fine for a point and shoot camera, handy h1 mic, flash units using cold shoe adapter, LED fill lights, etc.  I am going to use the 11"" arm to increase the height of a Fill Light set I bought...the stands are 7' and 8' is more of what I need.  In addition to height the arm will allow me to QUICKLY adjust the fill lights then lock them down as quickly as possible.  Imorden arms feel solid btw and you can tell they focus on Quality Control unlike other arm mfg's.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
UPDATES :: Yes...it's been a few months and I still am happy with the IMORDEN QUALITY.  The arms are holding up well and work reliably after several days of shooting each week.  Sudden 'shocks' 'jars' or 'bumps' can loosen the base cold shoe ""Locking Ring"" ... Still give them 5/5

It is very small (about the size of a deck of bridge cards) and I take it backpacking and all all of my trips.  I'm on my second one, first one stolen.  Weather brodcasts are a real nice touch, you don't have to wait for a TV or Radio announcement of the weather, when you can get the report and forecast direct from the NWS.
TV, FM and AM all work great.  Good memory setting features of about 10 for each band.
The Alarm is another nice feature when traveling.
Also nice is the internal speaker, which is rare on a radio this small with this many bands and features.  The fidelity is all that you would expect from a 1"" speaker, but it is fine for what is is for like listening to news or a talk radio show.  The audio is stereo on the headphones on AM and is of very high quality on the headphones for all bands (TV, WX, AM and FM(stereo)).
My only negative comment is minor, relating to battery life.  I have used alkaline and rechargables and I seem to only get about 8 - 12 hours, which is sufficient, but adds up over time.

Updated review - had it for 5 months & it just died!

Contacted magellan customer service about the problem I was having, answered a dozen questions about what happened when it died and they were absolutely no help. Unit is still under factory warranty and they refuse to give me a return authorization number so it can be sent in to be serviced. I am very disappointed since I used this gps daily for work. My wife has had her tom tom since 2009 and it still works. Bottom line I'll never buy another magellan product again. They lost a customer for life.

Updated review - 07/10/15 - Finally after 3 months of trying to contact someone at customer service I got through and they gave me a authorization number to return my like new unit for a refurbished one. It cost me $13 to send it by ups. It arrived today, I open the box and the refurbished unit is scratched all over. It looks like someone put it on the ground, stepped on it and dragged their foot across the concrete with it. I am extremely dissatisfied with magellan.

Updated review - 07/12/15 - The nightmare continues! I charged the refurbished GPS unit they sent me as a replacement overnight then I turn it on today and it won't hold a charge. I go out to my car to use the car charger and it's not getting any power from the cord so I check the cigarette lighter fuse and its good, still no power. I plug in my Bluetooth to see if it would charge and its getting power from the lighter outlet just fine. So once again I have to contact customer service, pay another $13 to ship it back, just to get yet another replacement GPS unit. Needless to say I'm not a happy camper! I would've given this unit no stars but 1 is the lowest I can rate it. Smh.",Updated review.,1410048000,

I looks great, it's light weight, and uses only one AA battery (what a weight and cost reducer!). Don't let anyone fool you, that one battery powers a lot of great features like Mega Bass and 40 presets(40 hours of battery life according to Sony if used in radio mode). In addition, it produces plenty of volume and great sound. A previous reviewer complained that the one AA battery did not produce enough volume. As far as I'm concerned, nothing could be further from the truth. There is volume to spare on this baby! You'll never be able to listen to it on full-blast.

My only (minor) complaint about this Walkman is the location of the preset selector switch. It's recessed, slim, and located below the LCD display. This makes it inconvenient to locate and operate while running on a treadmill, but its no big deal. The many benefits of this unit easily outweigh this minor disadvantage.

We use them for the TV monitors in our church, which have to set up and take down each week due to not having a building of our own just yet. From the first week we noticed some visual noise on one of the monitors. After trouble shooting we determined that the splitter was bad, replaced it but still noticed the noise. After another round of troubleshooting we discovered that two of the three cables were bad. We replaced one with a shorter 15' Amazon Basics and now that one TV works fine. due to the length of the second TV we need a 50' cable. I guess we will be purchasing another brand, perhaps Amazon Basics. One other thing, the 90 degree adaptors are a good idea, however they are useless since they don't fit any TV I have at home or the Church. The orientation is 180 degress out.
UPDATE:
A short time after posting the original review I was contacted by the company in an attempt to correct the problems stated above. They offered and actually did refund the price of the 15' Amazon Basics cable. They also sent at no cost two powered signal boosters and RH 90 degree adaptors. The  signal booster actually made the picture quality worse. So now we will begin our troubleshooting (isolation & elimination) process again to determine exactly where the problem lies. Once this round of TS is complete I will update again.
The company (customer service) has done well in trying to make things right but so far nothing has worked.
UPDATE #2 04/24/16:
The company has tried to make things better for us to the extent of sending three brand new cables that were supposed have been tested prior to shipping. Well one of the three was DOA. I contacted them and told them of the issue and informed that the we would be testing the other two at church. Those two performed well so we are at 66.6% of the way there. Again, I will stress that Twisted Veins Customer Service has done everything short of giving a full refund to make things right and satisfy its customer. I will update the rating one more star.
UPDATE #3
After the last Update I was contacted again by Twisted Veins and was told that they were giving us a FULL REFUND (which was unexpected) for the original purchase of the 50' cables. They have gone above and beyond in trying to make things right [signal boosters, RH 90 degree adaptors, three new cables, a full refund and they still guarantee the working cables for life]. The CS representative, Tiffany, was very concerned with how things were progressing and  apologetic with each contact whether via phone and email . Even though I'm disappointed in the way some of the cables performed, the way the company wanted to ensure our satisfaction is greatly appreciated.

- Large capacity (obviously)
- USB 3 for fast transfer, so far my average write speed is ~80-90MB/s, not up to my expectation but might be due to my lenovo laptop setup.

Cons:
- The middle black strip part will have your fingerprints on it
- Generate heats while using it. I can't understand why it's so hot, be it transferring files, or just plugged in without using it.

These headphones are amazing, but these aren't for everyone.  Who should buy these?  People that are easily irritated by random noises, ambient noise, that kind of thing.  What's that?  On my list, I'd put in dog barks, refrigerator hums, bathroom pipes, passing cars, wind and rain, etc.  I'm very sensitive to noise.  I bought a wall clock specifically without a ticking noise because it drives me insane.

A couple months ago, some dude moved into a nearby apartment unit.  He's got some kind of affliction that is a cross between emphysema and tourette's syndrome.  He'll make some sort of ""Hnnghh!"" sound every minute or so right out his window.  This goes on all day and all night and for someone like me who is easily annoyed, it can make a muhfuh go postal.

Now, I'm a headphone nerd.  I've got a Sennheiser HD-650, a Denon AH-D2000, tried all the upper-middle class Beyerdynamics, Audio Technicas and what have you.  How's this sound in relation to the grade A audiophile headphones?  The sound signature on these is a bit less bassy than your average Bose product.  If I use bass boost on my iPod Touch, it sounds about right.  It doesn't compete with my HD-650 or D2000 and you should not buy these if all you want is great music.

You should buy this if you can't stand stupid little distracting noises that drive you up the wall.  Have ADHD?  This is the headphone for you.  You can turn it on (one AAA non-rechargeable battery) and let noise cancelling work.  You can detach the wire so that nothing is in your way if you just really want to get work done.  I'm studying for the BAR Exam and little noises can derail an entire day.

You might be saying to yourself that you can just use earplugs instead of spending $300.  And you can.  I've used earplugs for the last few years.  These headphones are so much more comfortable, they block more noise, and you can actually put on music if you want.  It's one of those things that you didn't know you needed until you have it.  You'll also notice how you can leave the volume very low on your music player because there's no need to drown out extraneous ambient noise.  The perfect headphone for people with tinnitus.

Now, the aesthetics.  Let's face it, these look like garbage.  Who's the kind of person that thinks these look good?  Look at the stock photo.  Those are the people.  No style, no taste.  People who collect glass figurines.  Those people.  So this purchase is going to strictly be a utilitarian one.  Yes, it looks like crap.  But more importantly, it neutralizes noise.  My God, it's about as close as you can get to enjoying the silence of the night desert while living in the heart of a downtown metropolis.

If you're OCD about noise, if you're the kind of person who stays up all night on the internet and can't get to sleep for stupid reasons, if refrigerator buzzing, laundry and dishwasher cycles, passing cars bug you more than it does other people, then look no further.  Sell your kidney on the black market and get these ugly headphones.

EDIT:  December 12, 2011

One thing that bummed me out about these was the lack of bluetooth.  I turned these into a bluetooth model by ordering a Jabra Clipper.  I've use the excess wire to wrap the Clipper against the headband and now I'm completely wireless.  It pairs perfectly with my MacBook Air 2011 model.  No issues whatsoever.  I also have a Lenovo x120e, but it cuts out intermittently on that notebook.  Don't know if it's a Windows 7 issue or a Lenovo issue.  IPod Touch works without issue as well.

Just a little FYI if you want to go bluetooth wireless.  I imagine you're not limited to the Jabra Clipper.  It should work with other devices like the Sony Ericsson MW600, but I can't vouch for solid pairing.",I didn't know I needed this.,1321056000,

Within 3 weeks the unit was dead as a doornail.  Now, my niece is not rough with her possessions; she never even took this device out of her home.  Her mother attested to the fact that she was very careful with it and it simply wouldn't boot up one day, never getting past the splash screen (must be the ""freezing"" problem others are reporting here).

Even if this device worked properly I'd steer clear of it.  Here's why:

1) It is VERY cheaply made. I'm talking thin flimsy plastic. I took it out and loaded it up with songs for my niece before Xmas so that she'd have something to listen to right away, and I was stunned at how cheaply put together the thing is. Even the buttons are loose flimsy plastic, which surprised me coming from a big company like SanDisk. The thing is so poorly made it practically rattles.

2) The screen is pretty bad -- the font is big and blocky and not at all attractive.  I have a Cowon iAudio U2 player, which has a screen even smaller than the SanDisk, and even though the font on mine is smaller it's also FAR sharper and clearer.

3) The backlight is a joke -- it's literally a light bulb on the right-hand side that lights up and shines across the screen like a mini-flashlight!  I couldn't believe that when I saw it.  So the right-hand side of the screen is brighter, and the left-hand side is dimmer.

4) Ever wonder why you rarely see a photo of this device from the back or edge-on?  It's because it's not as slim as they want you to believe it is.  The back of the device is actually convex, curved outwards to accomodate the battery.  That also shocked me when I took it out, because it's about twice as thick as I was expecting.

So, I'll be returning this defective piece of junk toy. I already bought my niece a replacement: the Creative Labs Zen Nano Plus, which runs about the same price as the worthless M240. It certainly looks like a better unit, but I'll be back with a review once it's gone through a suitable trial period.","Flimsy, cheaply made toy that breaks too easily.",1170460800,

The only issue I have with the lens barrel housing. The camera was somewhat of a loose fit inside of this housing, and the camera would often shift just enough to cause some vignetting on one side of the frame. This isn't an issue with most of the stills, since they can be cropped easily. But it's a bit annoying for videos (which, btw, can also be cropped, but not as easily).  Sometimes, we had problems turning it on, because the lens wouldn't be aligned with the lens housing (causing the lens to bump into the wrong part of the housing, which causes the camera to turn off).

Despite these issues, this housing is a great buy if you'd like to take it in shallow water, especially for the price. Just make sure you test it thoroughly before using it. I'm not sure I'd stick a brand new, expensive camera in this thing, but I felt fine risking an older camera that's almost due for replacement. After all, it only takes a single failed seam or seal to ruin a perfectly good camera.

Some tips...
- Use the underwater setting on your camera, if you have such a setting.
- Keep your lens on its widest zoom setting and get close to your subject. Shooting distant objects won't look sharp, even in clear water.
- If you're shooting very close objects (like fish swimming a few inches away from the camera), don't forget to use the macro setting.",Great housing (for the price),1309219200,

I received a pair of Koss UR-20s as a gift years ago and loved them  so naturally I looked to Koss again when replacing my portable/on-the-go headphones. After buying a pair of KSC-55s, which sounded great but were uncomfortable for me personally, I hopped on Amazon and found everyone raving about the PortaPros. I figured they were good, especially considering that the design seems unchanged since the 1980s (which has to mean something), but I also figured that this was one of those things that was just too good to be true. However, these are bar-none the most amazing headphones I have ever put on my head. Listening to some of my favorite songs for the first time was one of those 'wow' moments where you realize you have found something that changes your expectations completely. The bar will be raised the instant you hear the bass response and incredible acoustic qualities of these light, comfortable headphones.
I don't know what I'm impressed with the most: the amazing bass, the excellent stereo division, or how loud they can get! These things are just as amazing as most of the reviews show them to be and then a lot more... I was worried about the eighties styling, but in person they don't look bad at all. I hate headphones that scream for attention, but these don't look like that when you have them on and I have already been wearing them in public (something I didn't think I would do after only seeing the picture of them online). And even if they're a bit outdated in appearance, the design is so functional you won't even give looks a second thought after you put them on.
One thing is for sure: these things have plenty of bass! Not too much (not ""boomy""), but they seem properly tuned for listening to things without ""bass booster"" turned on, which I like. Even with the bass settings adjusted high, the bass remains clear and crisp. I'm not sure how much power these can handle without damaging them, but I listen to them very loud and they do not sound distorted or stressed at all. After a few days my left speaker began making some weird noises and it ended up being a hair stuck inside the headphones that I cleared out with canned air. Something important to consider is that these are very open and airy headphones and the treble carries very well outside the headphones (so someone nearby could definitely hear what you're listening to if you have the volume up loud).
Others have mentioned that they felt the headphones were too tight feeling, but I have a very large head and they fit me without a problem. However, if I will be wearing them for an extended period of time I always set them to the ""Light"" setting on the comfortZone control (which divides the side pressure of  the headphones with your temples rather than just on your ears).
I already had headphones I was pleased with (Sony MDR-G52s and Koss UR-20s) but I wanted a set of small, portable headphones for use with my laptop and these are perfect. The folding design isn't something I necessarily wanted, but it is nice. The carrying case they come with (a leatherette bag) is a slightly tight fit and I probably won't end up using it much since it is not a hard case that would protect them from shock or crushing. Some others have mentioned that they feel delicate or are easily broken, but compared to other small headphones I have had they seem very well built and equally strong considering their light weight.
While I wouldn't say these are bad things about the PortaPros, it is worth mentioning that the headband is metal and will occasionally snag a hair as you adjust it on your head, and that they don't fold down as small as you might think they would so don't expect to put them in your pants pocket or something. Considering these are the worst things I can come up with to say about the PortaPros, they are nearly perfect in my book.
I can't say enough good things about these PortaPros! They're simply amazing. These are the first headphones (or speakers) I've had that sound absolutely awesome without adjusting the equalizer or pumping up the bass. They sound good on everything from R&B to Country and everything in-between. I've been especially impressed that they pull the bass and highs out of a song without getting that shrill, tinny treble that plagues so many headphones. If there ever was a question about the quality of Koss stereophones in my mind, these PortaPros have put it to rest and made me into a lifetime customer! If you're like me you'll wish you had discovered these legendary headphones (haha! how often is that said?) years ago...",You won't believe your ears,1083369600,

Once I got the radio programmed, I can say I really like it, It transmits well and power is as advertised. I get good signal reports and the receptions is good.

I have not tried all the functionality yet, but I will edit when I try the crossband repeater function which is the main reason I bought this.

In iOS, users can quickly add a period to the end of a sentence by double-tapping the spacebar. This shortcut adds a period followed by a single space so that you can get right on to typing your next sentence.
As of the new iOS update, a change of coding has the iPad double-spaced whenever a space was adding at the end of a word.

This feature can be resolve by going to your iPad:

Setting > General > Keyboard > Hardware Keyboard > deactivate the ""."" Shortcut, and restart your iPad.

Make sure you turn off the ""."" Shortcut under ""Hardware Keyboard"" setting, which only appears when a Bluetooth keyboard is connected to the iPad.

Original review: This case and keyboard seemed really promising at first, the case is nice by and the support system seems rugged. Battery life has been great. The thing that makes this a 1 star review is that the keyboard has either a short cut or a glitch that makes typing really frustrating. It will often do a double space and capitalize the next work if I type too fast. It will also add 3 commas at times.

I cannot speak for their other filters, but this is a circular polarizer and thus its primary criteria is how well it does THAT before anything else! And alas, it's not very good at it.
I like to give new and smaller companies a chance, looked at the overall positive review average and dismissed the negative ones as being too picky perhaps. Unfortunately, they were right...
But rather than simply reiterate their issues with this product, I'll try to upload a short video to demonstrate it, using it in front of an LCD screen (which works on the principle of polarization and thus is a great way for anyone to check this)
So not only is the X2 filter not even remotely 100% effective which is not good for obvious reasons, but whatever effectiveness it has results in a severe color shift to blue, which is a major issue if you manually set a white balance for a series of shots in the same environment. The B+W filter next to it demonstrates that it can be done, both in terms of effectiveness as well as neutrality. And interestingly it is a (Kaesemann) High Transmission one that this manufacturer claims is LESS effective. Now maybe there will be a claim that using the X2 filter is ""tuned for daylight, not screens"" or some such thing, but I'd like my filter to work in the same predictable way in ANY light condition. Again, the B+W filter demonstrates that this can be done.

So if you come with a similar expectation of performance as the posters of the positive reviews, great. But if you come with a similar expectation as mine (based on past experience), this product is not for you.","Good build, not so good polarization",1483660800,

I ended up sending one of the broken headsets back to Koss, along with a $6 check.  Turns out, these have a lifetime guarantee, and for $6, they will repair or replace them for you.  I got the new pair in rapid order-- total turn-around was about 10 days.  Caution--if you send these in for repair, do NOT include the pouch;  they returned only the headphones, without the pouch.  Anyway, it was really nice having the new headphones.  BUT, this morning, I picked them up to put into the little carry pouch I use for my Nano and headphones, and found that the left earpiece was dangling again, broken at the swivel point.
I really like the comfort of these headphones and the fact that I don't have to crank up the volume to hear.  But, I am now actively looking for a replacement to use, as these are obviously too frail for the constant folding and unfolding they get for my commutes to and from work.  Sorry to have to do this, but I would change my 4 stars down to 3 (but Amazon is not letting that happen).
If you will not be stuffing these in a storage pouch but will be simply laying them on a desk or table, then these are great.  If you plan to fold and open a lot, I now suggest you look for something more durable.
Sorry, KOSS!

origianal review Jan 6, 2007:
Quality good enough to make me get  a 3rd pair
I have gone through 1.5 pairs of these things, now (my current pair is nearly ready for replacement).  The first pair finally broke apart while folded in the soft bag that comes with it (I had had those about 6 or 7 years) -- I took them out and the left earpiece had broken at the plastic attach point and was left hanging.  My second pair is now only 2.5 years old (purchased April 2004), and the wire at the plug end is getting iffy.  If the wire moves, sometimes the phones go into single ear mode, so I guess one of the wires inside the very thin cable is breaking at the joint.  This plug has a right angle into the player, and it is right at the cord end of  the right angle piece where the wire is weakening.  I am going to try taping it here to keep it from moving, and see if that solves the problem temporarily.
I do side by side test with this headphone and others used by other individuals.  I ask them to put the volume where it won't blow out my eardrums, then I listen using their phones and settings.  I then plug in my portapros, and listen.  So far, I have not found anyone's setup to beat  the quality and clairty and volume delivered by these phones.  Usually, I have to turn the player DOWN when I plug in my phones because they pick up so much more than others.
If you are prepared to buy a new pair of these every 5 years or so, then these are definitely a good deal.
I just wish Koss would send a hard case for storage since I do believe that the soft case does not protect them enough when they are stowed.  Koss could also thicken the cable a little bit to make it more durable, or do a gradual thickening as the cable nears the plug.  When I get a new pair, I will tape that end of the cable to try to postpone this problem -- less than 3 years is too soon for this to happen.
Becasue of these two design flaws, I rate these a 4 intead of the 5 that the quality of sound delivers.
I listen to jazz, smooth jazz, pop, rock, and audiobooks primarily.

First, set-up was spectacularly easy.  I do not subscribe to TV so I only had to hook my player up to my (older) surround sound and new TV.  The TV recognized the player just by connecting the HDMI cable so that was a snap.  You have to buy a HDMI and ethernet cable so if you get a nice combination offer take it.  The Netflix setup was very easy.  All I had to do was log on to Netflix, enter the code, and line up a queue.  You choose the movies in your queue through the player which are displayed on the TV.  The only problem I have had with Netflix is that a movie stalled out halfway though and wouldn't restart until I turned it off then back on.  Also, sometime the ""resume playing"" feature doesn't work and you have to fast-forward from the beginning.

Next, I had to go buy a Blu-ray disc to test out that part.  The picture is absolutely amazing.  I can't get over how clear it is.  And here's where my biggest complaint comes in.  If you stop a movie and then go back to it, it starts over from the beginning.  I have a little portable DVD player that will remember where you left off.  Why can't a $500+ piece of equipment?  That is very frustrating.  You can try pausing the movie instead of stopping it but that does not always work.

All told, having streaming Netflix is great.  Now if only Netflix would stream all of their movies instead of sending them.  Think about it.  Why pay to mail something and the return postage if you can just send it over the 'Net?  Crazy.

***May 24, 2011 This is an update to my earlier review.  This past week my BD300 stopped playing Blu-ray discs.  It would read them, say ""disc error"", then eject them.  It would still play regular discs.  I called LG and they suggested using a cleaner disc.  I bought one this morning and used it.  The cleaner disc ran once and then after that the player would not play the cleaner or regular discs any more.  It said ""no disc"" and then went to the home screen.  Now I can either pay the postage back to LG plus $69 plus parts for them to fix it or buy another player.  Trust these reviews.  Our players have stopped playing discs.

My three big issues with the default pen that comes with the Surface are: a) it feels super cheap, like a 5 cent mechanical pencil... between how light it is and the surface texture, I didn't like holding it. b) There was a dead-zone with the tip - the moment the nib touched the glass, there was about half a mm of slop before the pen started registering which made fine work in photoshop difficult, and finally it only had one button - two are vital for photoshop when you often don't have a keyboard available.

So, with all those issues, I gave this pen a try and I have to say, it's fantastic!
- First, it doesn't feel cheap at all.  While not as substantial as say a Wacom pen, it has a great surface texture, is a little thicker and just /feels/ like a better made product.  It doesn't feel cheap and disposable like the Surface pen did.
- Second, probably the most important thing.  There is no dead zone on the tip.  As soon as the nib makes contact with the screen, the slightest pressure will register, there was no wobble room that made it hard to tell if i was going to lay down ink or not.
- Finally, It's a two button stylus.  The only other 3rd party two button stylus out there is like 80 bucks (the mod-book pen), so this is a fantastic deal!

There old fashion, take up way to much room , and made my kitchen look cluttered, and I think ugly looking.

  The Magnet on this was much stronger then I thought it was going to be, which is great.

 This is also heavy, and I hope the screws and all that came with it hold up, or we will just have to use heavier type of screws. So far, So good.

  This was easy to install, which is a big thing with my Hisband who is unhandy.

Most times it would take maybe 5 minutes to set it up and the ball was already attached! I don't mind taking a few seconds more to put the head on, because I'll leave it on, until the shoot is over.

Once in the phone, it performed flawlessly, capturing HD videos and pictures without any problems. It has only seen action for about 1.5 months, but so far, it is working just as it should. Except...

It is really, really finicky when it comes to transferring data to/from. With the old 32Gb card (different brand), I could transfer music, videos and pictures very easily by simply plugging the phone into a USB port on my PC and... presto! All of the phone's storage, including the micro SD card, were instantly recognized and accessible. With this new card, however, I was unsuccessful in gaining access to the card after many, MANY attempts.  Tried it in her phone, in my phone and in other devices. No dice. Ultimately, I had to put the card into a USB card reader and even then, it only worked in 1 of the 3 I own. I have a 64GB SDXC card in my phone (GS5) which worked without any trouble transferring data to/from my wife's phone while IN her phone, but for whatever reason, this card simply would not transmit data to/from the PC while in the Note 2.

Additionally, when first inserted into her phone, it recognized only 32GB. I've had that happen before, so no biggie... format the card. STILL 32GB. I had to put it in my phone, format it, then put it back in the Note 2.  Kind of a pain.

And I really wish it came with its own USB adapter. Does anyone actually use the SD adapters?

Other than those two (three, sort of) issues, I'm happy. Price was decent and as I said earlier, it has no trouble taking quality, stutter-free HD videos.","Plenty of storage, quick, fickle with transferring data",1402704000,

If the room is open (open walls), then the 3 will do, but the 5 probably better. To clarify why (and i don't have the Play:5 to compare) if you have the Play:3 in a large room, it sounds good, but the sound is very directional as you can imagine.

This case is yet another of my MoKo cases that I purchased here on Amazon. Personally, I found that there is MUCH to like about this case:

1) TEXTURED FLORAL COVER  The textured surface is easy to wipe clean and does not show dirt or stains. I just clean it with a semi-wet washcloth and go!
2) Thin Booklike cover with easy to close magnet closing. Since I read lots of eBooks, Kindle books, etc, I like to hold the tablet in Portrait mode with the case on it. I simply bend the cases cover back and read the book.
3) Has that designer look to it. Love that this case is different than the same old, same old cases
4) Well constructed case and easy to use the case in two positions from regular to a more flat typing kind of position.

This model made the cut because of its feature set and quality combined with a reasonable price.  With this system you get a full featured receiver with 4 HDMI inputs, one HDMI output, component and composit and 2 digital/optical audio in ports.

The remote is full featured as well although might be overwhelming to some.  Lots of buttons and you have to know what you're doing, its not a simple remote.

The speakers are not large but should be good for most living rooms in the 10' to 15' range.  You can use this system with other speakers that have wire leads, so you aren't bound by a proprietary connector.

The sub produces very nice thunderous bass and sounds amazing in my living room.  It may not be a 1000 watt system, but 600 is more than enough for most rooms.  I have to keep the sub volume turned down by about 20 percent to keep it from being too much bass.  And I'm one of those guys who loves bass, so if I feel like its too loud, it really is a lot of bass.

I love the versatility of the system, I can connect my iPhone or any other audio devices to the receiver and have amazing sound through this system.

One word of caution is that the bluetooth module for this system is extremely hard to find.  So if thats important to you, you may need to find another solution.  The iPhone dock is easily available, but not the bluetooth unit.

Another thing you might want to consider about configuring the unit, is that if you use AnyNet+ devices, when you turn off the TV it will turn off the receiver.  So if you are playing audio from another source and press the power button on the TV but want to continue to stream audio, you will need to power the Receiver back on after the TV is shut off.  That can get annoying, but is something you can configure or disable.

Overall this is a great sound system, I'm very happy with it.  Quality is great, brand name is great, sound is great, I love it.  Its a reasonably priced sound system for those who want high quality audio without spending too much cash.",Fantastic home threater sound system,1329955200,

The case doesn't add much weight to the kindle paperwhite,  it snaps on in a flash,  and the cover bends back easily when reading.
The case with its magnetic closure allows my kindle to sleep;  although if I manually turn the screen off when I stop, and then reopen it shortly thereafter,  the blank screen wakes up (which is good). However,  if it's been off for a while,  the screen wakes up partially while closed and you can see the ads when you reopen,  rather than a blank screen turning into the ad. I'm not sure if this is a Kindle issue or if it's the case. This of course can cause battery drain,  etc.  Other reviewers complained that this is due to the case.
Anyway,  I love it. It looks and feels like a decent lightly-rugged quality, although dropping it i think would probably be disastrous! I don't think this cover could protect from a fall, so the accident prone should get an otter box instead.  The felt-lined inside, and grippy outer cover are excellent. I feel like I don't need a screen protector either as I'm comfortable with just the cover doing the trick, and screen covers,  even non glare ones will add significant glare and alter the tactile experience, which defeats the owls of the paperwhite model.

For $15 though I don't expect it to last very long, and those who think it should should spend closer to $40 for a more durable case that would last a couple of years  If I get a year out of this one,  I'd be very satisfied.  I read almost daily for hours.  We'll see!",So far so good!,1445904000,

In terms of previous telephoto experience...I use a 70-200mm f/4L IS USM coupled with a 1.4 II Extender for my bird in flight (BIF) shots.  So I have shot up to 280mm.  To prepare for deciding whether to get this lens, I turned off IS and shot a bunch of pictures at sunset light level...BIF still turn out pretty decent. So Non-IS is not an issue. I went ahead and ordered this lens...like most BIF shooters, I do not have enough reach.

I got this lens via UPS...it was delivered at 6pm, half an hour before dark where I live.  Not enough time to go to the bird reserve to shoot so I started shooting in front of my house to test it out.  Shaking with excitement, I started to snap at various still objects, people walking about.  First impression was the lens is a lot heavier than the 70-200 f/4L + 1.4X. It's also a little longer and the tripod mount was interfering with where I normally hold the lens with my left hand. Everything via the viewfinder was magnified so much and I couldn't keep it from moving around.  Most of the shots I made was with 1/400, f/5.6 or slower.  The result was abysmal...out of 30 shots, only 3 were not blurred.  I also tried it with my cheapo $40 tripod and the result was slightly better but not by much. The tripod was shaking too much under the weight and the breeze.  Panic set in.

The next day, I left work early and showed up at the bird reserve. The light was brighter and I was able to shoot at 1/800 or faster.  I also paid attention to my breathing - back to basics. I moved the tripod bracket up and away so my left hand can hold on to the lens more securely.  The results were much better...I got a bunch of keepers whose sharpness and clarity is just as good as the 70-200mm but at twice the reach!  I felt much better.

A few days later (a Saturday) I went back to the bird reserve and spent half a day there.  I was a lot more used to the lens, its weight and bulk. I figured out how to hold the lens with my left hand to minimize shake. I learned to take deep breaths then release the shutter while exhaling.  I also cranked up the shutter speed to 1/1200 or even 1/1600 and set aperture at f/8 (its sweet spot).  The result was stunning...razor sharp images with vivid colors and contrast...I didn't have to do a thing to the images with photoshop...jaw dropping awesomeness! What a difference a prime makes!  I'm completely sold on this lens.

I realize that the IS feature on my 70-200mm coupled with relative short focal lengths spoiled me badly. I could just snap away happily and got good results (provided I can reach my objects).  With this 400mm lens, one must be more careful. At this FL, any movement is magnified and IS is not there to help you when you need it most.  I think I'm a much better photographer for learning to use this lens properly.  It also kick start me into thinking seriously about investing in a good tripod and gimbal head...almost time to join the big boys.

To see some of the pictures, use flickr dot com and search for user tongho58 (that's me).

- Wifi, though limited to 2.4GHz band, has great reception.  Mounted on my roof when I adjusted for aiming the camera, my Galaxy Note 3 (which is no reception slouch) had the lowest wifi reception possible so I was quite worried that this camera would get drop-outs or go dead off the network entirely.  Note the case at all.  This thing just blazes with speed at its maximal amount through other LAN devices.  I was amazed at how effective the antenna really is.

- Onboard processor is FAST.  Website is very quick to responses even over the Internet.  No frame rate problems or the unit resetting.  Works with IPcamview for Android very well, including zoom function.

- Optics are GREAT combined with the 3x zoom (controllable through the website)  Optical zoom was the main factor for me to choose this camera.  I point the camera at scenic vistas and the field of view needs to be zoomed in.  Most outdoor IP cams don't have optical zoom so would be useless.  I needed the ability to fine-tune my zoom level.  I only wish it had a bit more zoom range, perhaps 6x would be ideal, but 3x is good enough.  Optic quality is sharp and doesn't produce fuzzy images.

- Onboard website has quite a few functions, including setting dynamic dns to many sites, including the FREE service noip dot com.  (Don't pay for dyndns!)  Has FTP delivery of images and supports ONVIF.  Can turn IR lights off (important for me).

- Solid construction.  This thing is robust and I'm sure will have no problem being out in the heaviest of rain.  Rated waterproof for heaviest jetting of water but not to be submerged.  Front lens cover helps shadow the lens from glare and it WORKS... my camera points at the sun.

- Uses standard security cam power cable.... make sure you order this online since the stock length is too short to do anything with.  Hard to find this part in regular stores.  You can just buy the Siamese - two plug with video and just not use the video cable - cheaper that way.  Tape down the power connector.

- Lots of adjustment ability.  This thing rotates whatever way you want.  Website allows for mirror image and flip option.

Overall, I am very satisfied and this is the best security cam I have ever purchased and I have gone through MANY of them... I would go so far to say to put this sucker up to replace all regular DVR cams.  But for my purpose, I will be using as a weather webcam.

However, my TV had a curved back, so I used the included spacers to space the bars on the back of the TV. I was skeptical of the two lag bolts attaching the bracket to the stud under the drywall, so I added two 5/16"" lags, under washers holding the inside edges of the mounting brackets.

After installing the Swing Arm wall mount, I grabbed the end of the bracket, fully extended. The bracket didn't sag a bit. I concluded that the supplied two lag bolts would have been sufficient.

I've swung my TV out and exercised the various angles available, and found the swing arm not giving a millimeter.

FIRST REVIEW: This device wouldn't power on right out of the box. I see other negative reviews with similar issues. Might there be a quality control problem? Note also that Amazon Prime charged me return shipping. I'm obviously not happy about this.
****************************************
NEWEST REVIEW: After returning the unit via the Amazon returns program, I was contacted by a Miccus representative who had hoped that I still had the unit, and he could talk me through my issue, and/or replace the power supply, etc. I regretted that I had returned it so quickly, as this customer service was outstanding.

I still needed both send (TX)  and receive (RX) Bluetooth devices--i.e., two products--so I kept a brand x unit that works fine in send mode using my phone to broadcast into my old-school stereo and home theater system. But I decided to add additional wireless speakers to work throughout my house. So, I gave the Miccus RTX a second chance, and I also ordered their ultra-long range antenna, in the hopes that the combination would broadcast upstairs about hundred feet away, through walls and floors. Wow! it works perfectly. So I give the Miccus an A+. The earlier unit simply had a bad AC adapter. Thanks, Miccus, for reaching out to me.

No vids, no games (mirroring), nope - nothing else.  Thought about returning it then, but decided to wait to see how well it works with a new MBP.

MBP (2.6GHz i7 16GB, dual 7.2k rpm hd): what a waste of my time.  I upgraded to ML just for aTV...  Yes, mirroring worked, but not like for viewing movies at full resolution/24fps.  My MBP was 12' from the router, the aTV located 8' from the router.  (btw, a $130 Linksys/Cisco N router).  As for ""mirroring"", well, slow at best - most of the time there was a 12 sec delay... on anything.  So frustrating.  I ""reverted"" back to Lion where Airplay worked for pics...  oh but not so well for vids/movies.

iPad 2nd/iPad mini- oh forget it.  Decided to return the aTV to Amazon.

Pros:  Can display pics on the iPod/iPad very well on your home lcd.  This has great potential for photo studio purposes if one uses wireless units in their dSLRs.  aTV has really nice screen saver and the menu driven interface is as one would expect from Apple products.  Intuitive, easy to use, high quality.  Wireless configuration was such a breeze!  The packaging for this is second to none.  The included remote works with other Mac/Apple products - very nice.

Cons: Video files cannot be some of the more popular file formats.  Basically, they all need to be in Apple's iTunes compatible formats.  Price is a bit high, but consistent o all Apple's products...  ( this would have been my 6/7th Apple product).

The concept of being able to display my MBP screen onto a selectable (if you have more than one aTV in your location) LCD in my home/office wirelessly is really cool.  Maybe in the next release this will work.  BTW, for AirPlay works on Lion - you do not have to upgrade to ML.","So disappointing, I wish aTV was great/even good...",1357430400,

I wanted this for two reasons:

1) I wanted a slim magnetic case that would hold itself shut, protect my screen, protect the tablet from minor falls, and not add too much bulk.

2) I wanted a stand so I could use it on a desk without having to hold it.

It works great as a case that protects the tablet without adding bulk.  But the kickstand is horrible. The stand is hard to fold back, but flimsy enough that it won't support the weight of the tablet.  The tablet will just flop over, either on its face or on its back depending on if you're trying to have it stand in portrait or landscape orientation.  I have had a 0% success rate in keeping this tablet standing on its own using the origami-style kick-stand.  There's no support in it, so it's like trying to fold a cardstock in half and trying to lean a tablet on it.  If the tablet weighs as much as the Amazon Fire 7"", the paper would just fold over; the same thing happens with this case.

I really love ASUS but this router would not stay connected to my devices I have 4 computers, 4 Tablets and 3 phones in my house, those were fine, however all the other devices, 1 Laptop, Apple TV, Chromecast, Ecobee 4, Alexa Echo's/ Dots and wifi plugs were constantly disconnecting all day every day, especially Echo's, Echo Dots and Ecobee, so badly I had to reconnect them or reconfigure them every time!  I did try the router in 3 different modes smart connect, automatic and manual setup separately, with the same results disconnected devices!
This is my 2nd one in 3 weeks, the first one returned the 1st one thinking I received a bad router and purchased another, set up again, updated the firmware online, the exact same results everything was disconnecting all the time half of my Echo's and all of my wifi switches are offline my Ecobee thermostat is offline and my TV won't connect even as I write this review my house is in really bad no wifi shape.
I called Asus support to make sure I wasn't missing something, the phone support person really liked that I knew what I was doing and made the recommendation that I add a 2nd router in repeater mode, (this option would cost me a minimum of another $100-200). Wow this is the AC3200 and my house is only 3000sqft; He said it had to do with all my 2.4ghz devices.  I asked them why the previous router (TP-LINK AC3150) didn't have a problem with keeping all my devices connected, I honestly never had any issues until it died (I didn't buy another because it only lasted 1 year). He made some explanation on the Asus being a good router but not if the area is congested, I explained that I had used a wifi analyzer app and didn't have that many close wifi networks ( I Live in a normal neighborhood regular 2 story wood framed house), not an apartment complex so that shouldn't be an issue.  He suggested that I manually lock into one of the channels like 1,7 or 11 that the other routers were not on, which I did, then more disconnections occurred!  I finally pointed out to him that the dual router setup he wanted was a Mesh type of router setup and the cost didn't justify the possible benefits, He then offered up the Asus Lyra as a solution to the problem ( the reviews were even worse for the Lyra), so I finally thanked him for his time and got off the phone.
Final Thoughts:  A second wifi router in repeater mode may have worked if I was in a crowded wifi area, but seriously another $100-200 to create basically a mesh-type network, why don't I just go buy a mesh network router? (Asus Lyra no way bad reviews, from reputable sites), Why not the Google mesh that has an excellent review? ""Yes""!
Ultimately I am boxing it up and returning it to Amazon as soon as the Google Wifi System gets here!
So the Google wifi I purchased is up and running all the devices are connected again with no issues at all!","Really Bad with Amazon Echo, Ecobee/ Zwave Connected homes.",1510444800,

I usually use it to clone hard drives with the latest download of the EZGig IV. I like to get the latest ISO from their web site and burn it to a CD. It only takes a few minutes and works reliably except for some uncommon RAID controllers.

Before this Apricorn I'd been very happy using the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apricorn-DriveWire-USB-2-0-to-IDE-PATA-SATA-Universal-Hard-Drive-Adapter/dp/B000QY9KIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apricorn DriveWire USB 2.0 to IDE/PATA/SATA Universal Hard Drive Adapter</a>&nbsp;which also supports larger 3.5 inch drives and older PATA desktop and notebook interfaces. That was great but now I wanted more speed upgrading desktops and notebook drives to SSD drives. This also has the advantage of not needing an external power source.

In a USB 2.0 plug it is backward compatible and runs at speeds like my old Apricon. Ho Hum. But when a USB 3.0 is available it rocks!

In my use the EZGig software has worked reliably except with some advanced RAID adapters. As I mentioned I prefer to use the bootable ISO image from their web site. Automatic partition adjustments seem to work pretty well most of the time but I use the manual option most of the time. For example, when I'm cloning a Dell hard drive I want to make sure all the partitions stay the same size except the partition that is the C drive.

The interface does not require using EZGig - you can just use the connected drive as a hard drive! If you are like me and have lots of hard drives hanging around and maybe just want to get some files off of one this will do the trick with a compatible hard drive.

One thing I'm not crazy about is how short the USB cable is. I got a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/USB-3-0-extension-cable/dp/B00C7S1B4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">USB 3.0 extension cable</a>&nbsp;to give me more flexibility to set the drive on top of something rather than dangling it from the interface connection (in the worst case).

If you want to temporarily connect an external 2.5"" or smaller SATA drive using USB 3.0 this is a good choice. If you want an external USB drive for longer term use either a drive like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WD-My-Passport-Ultra/dp/B00E055H5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WD My Passport Ultra</a>&nbsp;or get a case for your own drive.

The Apricorn SATA USB 3.0 adapter does it's job well for me. I wish the USB cable were maybe a foot or so longer but no other down side. The Apricorn EZGig software works well and has been well maintained. When a USB 3.0 plug is available it saves me time and that earns it 5 stars from me.

Do your homework. Search the web for how to set up your PC to best utilize a SSD. Otherwise you will not get the performance you want and expect. It is not hard, just takes a bit of research to find a site that lists the proper settings. However, once you do, you will find that your PC comes up in seconds. No more disk thrashing and slow startup. It is great!!!

I use my system to dual boot into Windows or Linux. That can be a bit of a challenge to go from an existing dual boot to the same configuration using a new drive. That is not an SSD issue, it is just a logistics issue with setting up a more complex configuration than the average simple Windows, single-boot configuration.

I installed my Windows 7 OS from scratch and kept the previous drive in the system for a while to be sure I had access to the previous Windows install. I can boot up either the old hard drive or off of the SSD. What a difference in boot-up time.

It can be operated in simple point and shoot automatic mode or can be controlled manually for real camera buffs. The owner's manual is very basic with no detailed information and you must use the included DVD to discover all the capabilities of the camera.

Buy the Onkyo on Groupon for $299 instead.

01/29/2016 update:

After a couple years, with no changes to my connections, anytime a loud noise happens on TV or I play some rock and roll, the receiver shuts off and I restart it to see on the front panel ""Check SP Connection.""  The receiver shorts out and I haven't moved or changed a thing.  Truly, in my whole life, this is the crappiest piece of electronics I've ever owned.

Original review:  I don't like having to switch between HDMI on my TV so, when I have an entire weekend to waste, I'll reconfigure the thing to run it all through the single HDMI out.  Right now, the shortcut buttons on the receiver and remove are Hell-bent for leather to run TV sound from the TV to the optical in, but I want to run the HDMIs from the xfinity x1 box, AppleTV, Dell computer and Karaoke player through the receiver and then all through the one HDMI out, so I don't have to use the TV remote, in addition to the x1 and Yamaha remote (the TV functionality on the Yamaha remote is nearly worthless with a cable box).

And Apple AirPlay cover art on the TV...fuggeddaboudit...hence the need to keep the AppleTV that I WAS going to put on another TV, still on this one.  (The graphics from this receiver to the TV are worse than the original video games of the 70's.  Really pathetic compared to every box I've ever attached to a TV.)

The iPad app is overkill.  How often do you need to re-callibrate the receiver via an iPad???

I'm very tempted to give this a ONE star, but it was only $300 and tax.  ONLY.  Maybe my house will burn down and I can get replacement cost and buy a Pioneer.

And, no, I would not recommend this receiver to a friend...an enemy, most certainly, but not to a friend.

Next day update...the auto off (ARC, I believe it's called) worked at first, then it didn't, then I changed a setting in the HDMI setup and it did again and, by the end of the first night it didn't, although the HDMI setting is still the same.  This is one flaky receiver.  I should have realized that their receivers would be no better than their motorcycles.  My best friend and I both had 350s back in the day and they were oil-burning, plug-fouling pieces of junk.

Black Friday 2014...the 675 is the same price I paid for the 575...was tempted, but I seemed to remember reviewing the 575 and glad I checked.  To think I'd buy another Yamaha receiver...HA!

I bought it to take on a 16-day European vacation, so I would have a method of creating a back up of my videos and photos. The added benefit was that my video was already on DVDs and ready to play when I got home.  : )  The DVDirect is lightweight & compact, so it fit well in my suitcase.  Once I read how to connect my video camera to the DVDirect (which is uncomplicated), the machine prompted me through the remaining steps, which are few and simple.  For videos, it worked great for my purposes, because my video camera has 80GB of memory space, but I wanted to create a backup of each day's recording, just in case my camera was stolen or dropped.  (We all know someone who has lost many or all of their vacation video or photos for one of those reasons.) The DVDirect has an option to burn only NEW data that was not previously burned to a DVD.  So, each day, I would do an ""incremental"" burn from my camera to the DVDirect, so that only the new video was added.  If the disk wasn't full, I wouldn't ""finalize"" it (which you're given the option via a prompt when you select the ""eject"" button), so I could add additional video to the same disk the following day.  Since the DVDirect tells you how many disks are needed after you select either a ""full"" or ""incremental"" transfer of video, it is easy to know how many disks are needed to complete the task.  Burning photos to DVDs is equally easy.  Just stick your memory card in the appropriate slot on the DVDirect and follow the prompts.

The SD880 is a much better camera, costs less than the SD450 did in 2005 and is still tiny (fits in the same case). The improvements are many: ultra-sharp 28mm wide-angle lens with 4X zoom, 3"" bright and clear LCD, both optical image stabilization (IS) and a new low-noise (for it's size) 10MP sensor.

A few reviews here report crappy images and/or high noise levels but those are not my findings, at least not relative to other point and shoot cameras. I tested the SD880 against: her Canon SD450 (5MP), my Fuji F31fd (6MP) and a borrowed Panasonic LX-3 (10MP).

SD880 images are sharper than any of the three other cameras at the same f-stops and focal lengths.  This is especially true regarding the SD450.  Given the Leica pedigree on the LX-3's super fast (f2.0-2.8) 24-60mm lens I had expected it to be sharper than the tiny SD880 so was surprised to find noticeably sharper images with the SD880 even near the edges of the frame.  Although the Fuji is just 6MP, it is closest in sharpness to the SD880, but only in good light at lower ISO.

The SD880 produces lower image noise at high ISO's (400 and up) than both the SD450 and the LX-3.  Beating the LX-3 in this test at ISO 400, 800 and 1600 was also surprising given the LX-3's slightly larger sensor size. The Fuji has the lowest noise level at high ISO BUT images become overly smoothed with less sharpness than either the SD880 or the LX-3.  The SD880 retains more sharpness than the Fuji as ISO is cranked up to 800 and 1600, but did have more noise. ISO 400 noise is low with the SD880 and images are usable at ISO 800. ISO 1600 should be reserved for low-light emergencies where flash is verboten and if prints are kept 6"" x 4"" or smaller.

Another low-light advantage of the SD880 (at least for nearly stationary scenes) is the optical IS. This really works and allows lower ISO values to be used with longer shutter speeds. My wife often blurred shots on the SD450 due to camera motion. The IS has helped a lot to reduce this.

UPDATE: The optics on my wife's SD880 are so sharp that I decided to get one too.  My copy produces softer photos, not really fuzzy and about as sharp as the 6MP Fuji but without the super crispness of the first SD880. I can clearly see the difference.  My revised conclusion is that it is possible, but not certain, to get a Canon 880IS with exceptionally sharp optics.  For that reason I would downgrade my rating to 4 stars if Amazon would permit (they don't).  Good luck.",Tiny Camera with Outstanding Optics ... If You Get a Good One,1226880000,

First, most of these camcorders down-res to something like 1440 x 1080, even though they advertise meeting the full-HD spec of 1920 x 1080.  Second, the compression used to accomplish this is fierce, and has very visible artifacting.

So, in essence you have a class of camcorders, advertised as HD-quality, that can ONLY produce true HD in very good lighting with almost no motion.  Think test patterns here, or landscapes.  Poor lighting and motion in the picture give most of these camcorders fits, as the AVCHD codec just can't handle the extra work imposed by video noise from low light situations or any motion-induced artifacting.

What to do?  Well, in typical Canon fashion they sat back, waited to see what everyone else produced, and then released a product that is the best of the genre.  Sure, you can get larger drives on the Sony -- up to 80GB.  The Sanyo may tout it's tiny form factor, and make exaggerated claims about its' image quality.  I owned the Sanyo HD1000 and promptly sent it back; both the quality of the device itself AND the quality of the images it produced were lacking.

The Canon gives the best image I've seen on an AVCHD product.  Though not perfect and nowhere close to their own HDV-based HV20, I wanted something non-linear to make working with video a little simpler on my Macs.  The HG10 has great image stabilization, wonderful optics, intuitive controls (I especially love the multi-speed zoom control), superb colors, and less of the AVCHD nasties than any other AVCHD camcorder I've seen.  It also works superbly on my Mac with both iMovie and Final Cut Express 4.  It is phenomenally easy to work with non-linear video; in my case this probably overrides the loss in quality to HDV.

So, if you must own a camcorder that uses AVCHD, this is the one to have!  On absolute terms I'd give it three stars, but compared to other AVCHD camcorders it's a five, so four stars overall felt about right...

[UPDATE ONE: Canon has just released new AVCHD camcorders -- the HF10 and HF100 -- that record at the full HD 1920 x 1080 spec.  They will offer improved quality, but the bitrate is less than the comparable Canon HDV units, so there will be some losses to compression.]

[UPDATE TWO: one issue with the HG10 regards the use of external microphones.  I just recorded three hours of interviews with an external mike mounted to the camera's ""flash shoe"" accessory attachment point.  There is a a low level noise present, which is caused by the microphone picking up the noise from the hard drive.  I can probably minimize this in editing, but be careful about your choice of external microphone -- and mount it off-camera if possible!]",As good as it gets for AVCHD (at present)...,1197504000,

I also have http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TKHBDK, and I liked the free scroll feature (which I don't use a ton, but it comes in handy). So I thought for my desktop this would be a great, decently priced mouse.

I received the mouse, and started to use it. I soon noticed, however, that the right mouse button was extremely sensitive to being clicked. I was often right mouse clicking while resting my finger on the button. There was still a ""click"", but it was just too easy to press compared to the left mouse button. I sent it in to be replaced, and the replacement is somewhat better, though the right button is still easier to press than the left. In my mind they should be the same.

Also, even when the wheel is in normal clicking mode, it is much too easy to scroll when middle clicking, and middle clicking takes a lot more pressure than I would like. It was so hard to middle click that I ended up mapping the tilt action to the middle click for games (you'll need uberOptions to do this). I should also note that some of these mice at my work seem to have difficulty middle clicking at all without also engaging the wheel tilting.

So it's a decent mouse, and the price was right, but I would go for something different next time.","Right, middle click woes",1327968000,

I visited different stores to look at displays and every time I would leave a little less sure of what I wanted. I knew I wanted a 4K because I edit 4K video but I also wanted a good deal. It was all overwhelming but I am so happy with my decision to go with this 65"" unit. It has a wide variety of apps and settings so that you can customize it to be exactly the way you want it. So far, I have not found anything about it that I do not like except for the stand that came with the tv. I ended up mounting it but the few days before it was mounted I was little worried about how flimsy the stand was.

Picture Quality -
The picture on this tv is absolutely stunning. While 4K content is hard to come by except on Youtube when you find a 4K video it's breathtaking. The television also does a great job with upscaling 1080p video and a decent job with 720p. Anything below that does look pretty rough but that's to be expected with any of the 4K televisions. I've noticed that when I run streaming video from a program like Netflix via my computer or game system to the tv through HDMI the quality is noticeably lacking compared to watching it through the built in app. It's not horrible on the other inputs but there is a difference even when the video settings of the tv are the same. I personally hate the ""Soap Opera Effect"" that some units have. This tv has the settings that allow for this effect but you can easily turn them off. It has a wide range of motion settings - one of them even helps my friend that gets motion sickness from shaky camera effect on some shows. We don't have cable or any type of satellite service so I can't speak for how it would work with that but I would imagine that you wouldn't have any issues. My last tv was a plasma and I was worried about the depth of the blacks but I haven't noticed any difference.

Using As A Computer Monitor -
This tv works great as a monitor with Mac computers. I have not tested it on a Windows based system but for Mac it's amazing. The colors are crisp and playing video files, games, or surfing the web from your computer comes through just as clear as anything else.

Gaming -
The picture quality when using this with a gaming platform or gaming on your computer is flawless. You can also use it directly with a Playstation controller if you purchase the Playstation Now service through Sony. There aren't any issues that I have noticed except that it looks so good you won't want to turn it off.

Apps & OS -
There are a wide variety of apps available on this television from videos, to weather, to gaming. It runs an android operating system and so far I haven't had any problems with it. The initial setup takes about 30 min of firmware updating but you can bypass it and tell it to update when you aren't using it. It seems to stay in a hibernation period all the time unless you do a reset. Hard resets take a few minutes to boot up just like a computer would.

Sound -
The internal sound on this tv isn't anything special. We don't use it. If you are going to purchase one of these televisions I would get a soundbar or a decent surround sound system.

Remote -
The remote is pretty basic except for the addition of a Netflix button. It works well and I haven't had any issues with it. You can also use a bluetooth keyboard with the tv if you'd like so you don't have to type in searches on your apps or Youtube.

I'll update this review if anything changes over time but so far I highly recommend this tv and the delivery service that Amazon provided was top notch.",One of the best decisions I could have made...,1451606400,

It was kinda my fault but it gave me a chance to purchase this which was about double the price of what I wanted to get. This CB Mini-RC is about the best kind of bracket built for a flash and it has made shooting with the flash close to the lens alot easier for shadows to exist less when shooting red carpet photography. I have kept this thing on a Canon 7d with a grip on the bottom for vertical shooting and it has not bothered me at all when I am shooting vertical. I would say the lens that would work the best with the flash being close to the lens would be a 24-70 or a 17-50 lens. The stroboframe I had made my camera even more heavier and wasn't as stable as this bracket. I would definitely recommend this bracket as something to get if you need your flash to be closer to the lens instead of switching it back and forth that the stroboframe has you doing. The strobo has the flash leaning forward which puts a strain on your back if you carry the camera for a long time while the CB-mini has a lot less stress on the wearer.,Best Bracket,1303948800,

His was a jawbone though. I even borrowed it for couple days very nice . But once I heard the price my face  jawbone dropped. So I started price cheking around went online . Looked on amazon I seen  all these types of differen bluetooth speaker's but I wasn't gonna pay 160 dollars for the jawbone don't get me wrong good sound . So Iooked and looked read about what they have inside . how they function reviews on different BT speakers. Well l noticed these bad boy's . They stood out from the rest the way the sat up and looked longer then the rest . So I ended up back to these on my screen I read what they have again compared them. and when I read it had 3 speakers not 2. 2 for your mids & highs and 1 more for the bass I had to try them . I made a great choice and saved money. For 50 dollars compared to like 160.00 to 200.00 dollars . They sound great very clear crisp clear with some nice bass humming. It fills a room with sound easily. You can hear every detail from instruments to voice clear . And speakerphone works like a champ they can hear me clear and I can hear them clear. Easy setup also battery life is good. It sounds better then my brother louder more sound .

I decided to upgrade to X99 and wanted an ROG board since I have owned the maximus extreme before and I wanted top of the line overclocking. I decided on this board over the rampage counterpart because I saw it to be more applicable to mainstream workloads that still had everything you could really want as someone who overclocks for 24/7 performance rather than chasing records. The WiFi pretty dang good. It almost matched my router (which was right next to my computer) and now that I moved my router across the house it gives a better signal than my router so I use it as a hotspot. I currently have an i7-5820K installed with 32gb of ram. The ram is running its XMP profile at 2400MHz cl12 and the CPU has custom settings with up to 4 utilized cores at 4.6GHz and all 6 cores utilized running at 4.4GHz. It did pretty outstanding in Realbench with all 6 cores running at 4.7GHz with the voltage around 1.35V. This is an extremely capable motherboard in terms of overclocking and I absolutely love the bios. The asus advanced bios is actually one of the top reasons for buying their boards. The ROG board was a bit easier to navigate in terms of deeper settings, but I love the bios that is in the x99 series. I am one of the weirdos that loves AIsuite and I have it running all the time. It is much more manageable with 32GB of ram than say 8GB since it does take up some space and I use a lot of memory, but it doesn't bother my speed. Everything so far has been plug and play with Win10 and I only really needed the driver disk for software. I felt iffy about buying this board at first, but if you want to complete that high end built.. this is a great choice.

 I LOVE having the on-board buttons for when you are troubleshooting after heavy overclocking or failed devices. I used them literally all the time back when I was overclocking but not that I am only looking for high stable overclocks I don't really need to use them much. But, I love that they are there.

Down sides: only 2 mid-board usb2.0 headers which can be a pain because I have 2 corsair link devices so I had to forego using the usb2.0 headers on the front of my case. This is common in many boards though and there are ways around it.. I just don't care since I use 3.0.

1244641,1,2,True,"03 14, 2013",A31950YH6PNDI6,B001M04RBK,,J. Croft,"I had looked at several shelves and desks before deciding on this product. I am a pretty capable carpenter so I considered building my own solution, but I use my treadmill for running when the weather prevents me from running outside. Every design I looked at or came up with took too much space to make for comfortable running and just didn't allow for easy removal.

What I love about this is I can take it off in one step now that it is setup correctly.

To give some details about my usage:

-I am using a Macbook Air 13"" on it, so a very light laptop.
-I am walking at 2mph which is very comfortable for my gait. others may want to walk slower
-I am working completely wirelessly. My battery lasts for several hours so no need for cords at all

Now to talk about a few specifics on the shelf with those usages in mind

*Ease of Setup*

I found this was very easy to setup. My treadmill has a center support bar and a magazine rack that is actually the perfect height to mount the shelf with a bit of added support while having the top of the shelf at the top of the console as directed. It took me just a few minutes to review the directions and set it up the first time. Now it takes a few seconds to take it down and set it back up when I transition to running or back to walking.

*Space*

The shelf is plenty large enough for my laptop. I was concerned that the strap that secures the laptop would cover the top row because it is actually wider than the top space available, but with the angle I have the screen opened to it fits perfectly for my function keys to be open. The only problem is the MBA is so thin that the strap only has a couple inches of velcro connected. I wish it had more touching, but it feels pretty secure.

Additionally, I found that I can leave the shelf on for running. I had been taking it down but yesterday I decided to watch a video on my laptop while I ran. The only time I had a problem is when I almost fell over laughing during the video, but I can't say that is a problem in the product, just my own coordination.

*Comfort*

On my treadmill , with my laptop, and my height (6'1"") I find that the keyboard is the right height for comfortably typing and the laptop screen can be angled perfectly for best viewing.

Someone a good bit taller with a similar setup may have problems with the heights and viewing angle, though there is still room for adjustment in my setup which should resolve both issues for someone up to maybe 6'6"". There isn't a way to raise it up much more than a few of inches though. I'm basing this on setting the incline on my treadmill, which effectively raises you above the console. At the highest setting I couldn't get the shelf to work comfortably for me and the viewing angle made it less than ideal so I can see this being an issue for the very tall.

*Sturdiness*

OK, this is probably the closest to a negative. I wouldn't take a star off though because it feels strong on it's own merits. This is a plastic shelf, plain and simple. I can lightly rest my hands on the palm rest of my laptop and I do not feel like I am going to break anything. I would be concerned if I lost my balance and put my weight onto the shelf, but it would take something very sturdy to make me feel differently. I am walking at a comfortable speed so I never really feel like I am going to fall forward and break anything. The one time I tried it while running I wasn't trying to type anything. When I did laugh and start to stumble I reached for the support bars on the treadmill, which is what they are there for. I've been running on this treadmill long enough that it wouldn't occur to me to reach for this shelf.

*Wrap Up*

So to close this all down, I'd say this is well worth the price. I am burning over 1000 calories by walking while working instead of sitting while working and that is great for my weight loss goals. I had hit a bit of a plateau and this has already helped make a big difference. For my setup this works great and there is a good deal of flexibility so it should work in many other configurations. For the price I am very happy and hope to get many months out of this product.",Burning calories while I work,1363219200,

I have used the Everki Beacon Bag with all these laptops as well. I love new technology and if I have the cash I buy it. This laptop was bought though with the pure intent of complete and utter future-proofing myself as well as finally getting the most powerful mobile gpu out upon release for once. (I usually am behind on the technology.) I really am hoping for about a 5 year lifespan at minimum on it, I know I'll have to lower details over time, but for now I am enjoying full ""Ultra"" or ""High"" details (depends on max settings for a given game.)

Games I currently play are: Minecraft (I run a server as well, not on my laptop but is hosted elsewhere), Saints Row 3 and 4, Sims 2 and 3, Farming Simulator Titanium Edition, Starbound, Terraria, Bioshock (all), Borderlands 1 and 2, Diablo 3+ expansion, Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars+ expansion, Supreme Commander 1 and 2, Dungeon Defenders plus many others. This laptop plays all that maxed out and at 1080p no problems! Now I know I haven't listed many heavy hitter games, but i can say that this will play anything out now at 1080p on ""High"" and I may be conservative on that.

Build Quality:
The Alienware has the winner on this for build quality, with it's reinforced alloy frame, but this laptop isn't very far behind on quality. This laptop is a cross between the Alienware and the Sager. The Sager had a better build quality than the Samsung I felt.
This doesn't mean this laptop is cheap feeling, far from it. It's got just about as good a feel as the Alienware did but not quite there. The keyboard does feel much better than the Sager, but the Samsung's keyboard was a winner in that spot. The screen on this laptop doesn't wobble as much as the Sager did or the Samsung did. It's a tie between the Alienware and this one. Also, this laptop probably has more of an Alienware look than the Sager or Samsung one did with the multi-color keyboard and extra lighting.

Features: This is a hard one to compare, but personally this laptop wins out.
6x USB 3.0 ports, 2x Mini Display ports as many audio connections to support 7.1 surround should you want it. This laptop also has a blu-ray BURNER! which was more than what the Alienware had with it's default DVD-Burner. This laptop also has a direct button for switching between the dedicated GTX980M and Integrated GPU. This requires a reboot but the Alienware can do this as well with a Function key. But there is pretty much a shortcut button for this.

Performance: This is unfair as each laptop was pretty much an upgrade over the previous one. So obviously this MSI laptop outbeats the past ones.

Price: MSI wins, for $2300 you get a beast of a laptop. Alienware (as of this writing) doesn't have the 980M gpu and will probably charge far more for the same setup.

Cooling: The cpu seems to sit at about the same temperatures as previous cpus, but the gpu maxes out at about 72C when being pushed to it max during benchmarks which obviously push it to it's max. (Chances are I won't max this gpu out for a little while.) This laptop has an excellent cooling system. It does get a little loud when the fan ramp up to max, but I took a like at the physical fans and they are the largest fans I've seen in a laptop. Max speed I hear a faint whine, but chances are your gonna be gaming and not notice it, and honestly if anyone else complains they should just shush up themselves. (I wouldn't suggest gaming in a library, while it may not be super loud that's just disrespectful, but ultimately any ambient noises will probably drown this laptop. Also I must note that the fan noise is only noticeable at max speed which you may not reach, I only reached it by hitting the ""Turbo Fan"" button. Even when benchmarking I didn't notice the fans much if any.

Storage:
This comes with a single 128GB m. 2 SSD and a 2.5"" 1TB 7,200RPM HDD. This laptop only supports ONE 2.5"" drive, unless you replace the optical drive with a Hard drive caddy. BUT! It has a total of 4 m. 2 slots. with current m. 2 SSD's you could put 4x 512GB SSD's in plus the 2.5"" HDD! SSD's are coming down in price pretty good, I remember when a 64GB might have cost $300+ now it's nothing. A 512GB SSD now cost about $280 now! a few years ago that would have been probably $1000 or more!
I do plan on adding in an SSD very soon. I also must state that MSI DOES include all the screws needed to add in more m. 2 SSD's.

Audio system: The Dynaudio system on this MSI blows me away! The Sager plain sucked, I will admit it, The Alienware sounded really good as well as the Samsung, but the MSI's blows them away in my opinion. Now I'm not a audiophile and far from it, but I enjoy listening to my music as much as the next person and also like to share music or videos with others and this sound system can fill a medium room pretty decently. There is plenty of range and it is far from sounding tiny!

Overall, I am VERY pleased so far with this laptop and plan on upgrading it's 128GB SSD with a 512GB SSD. I will keep the original SSD as a Driver/ Dump drive until I can afford a second, third and fourth 512GB SSD. But otherwise it is one BEAST of a laptop without being HUGE! It is even outdoing my desktop somewhat and that has a GTX 770 SC gpu in it. (I read it could rival a 780 which may be overkill for my personal needs, but I got the money so why not?

Incidentally I have to get rid of my desktop due to downsizing on my living arrangements which is why I was forced to another laptop, so I just decided to go all in this time around. Short of if I could upgrade on my own I figured I would just do that on my own for a tad cheaper.

I will update this review if anything changes or after 6 months of ownership with plans on updating my review every 6 months until I can't edit/ update it anymore or get rid of the laptop.

All in all if you got the cash, I suggest this laptop if you are looking for something to game on the go, i really don't think it will let you down!",One beast of a machine!,1413072000,

I expected an average picture at best, but I was blown away at the image that I was viewing for my bargain-priced purchases. I own some digital frames, and I have seen several others. Images on many small frames are grainy, washed out, unnatural, or any combination of the three. The images on this one were exceptional. If you can catch them on sale again, they are well worth it up to about $60'ish, maybe even $70. I have bookmarked the page to watch for future sales. If they drop that low again, much of my holiday shopping will finish early for a change.

I purchased these as gifts for my mom's and mother-in-law's desktop, not as presentations. I preloaded the images and sent them on their way. I have not tried any MP3 or movie playback. While I can understand that other people might want these functions, they were not amongst my deciding factors.

PHOTO TIP for Windows users: In order to get the most out of the storage, your loaded image resolution should closely match the frame's native resolution of 640x480. This is easy to do without any additional software. Go to the folder that contains your pictures. Select the first image you want to load by a single LEFT-CLICK (and release). Now press and hold down the control key. WHILE HOLDING DOWN THE CONTROL KEY, select additional images in the same LEFT-CLICK (and release) manner that you selected the first image. All of the selected images should be highlighted in whatever Windows theme you are using. If they are all highlighted, release the control key.

READ CAREFULLY: DO NOT LEFT-CLICK ANY PHOTO WITHOUT THE CONTROL KEY PUSHED BECAUSE IT WILL ""DESELECT"" ALL OF THE OTHER IMAGES. THE SAME ""DESELECT"" WILL OCCUR IF YOU RIGHT-CLICK OVER ANY NON-SELECTED PHOTO.

To shrink the images to your frame's native resolution, place your cursor over one of the selected images and do a RIGHT-CLICK (and release). At this point, a window will come up with several options as to what you want to do with the selections. There will be a ""Send To"" option with an arrow next to it. Hover your mouse over, or LEFT-CLICK (and release), the ""Send To"" line. This will cause another side window to appear. When it does, LEFT-CLICK (and release) the ""Mail Recipient"" option.

A window will appear asking whether you want to keep make the images smaller, or keep the original size. Ensure that the ""Make all of the images smaller"" is selected, then LEFT-CLICK (and release) the ""OK"" button. When the email pops up with all of your attachments, place yourself in the address line, and send it. The images you receive will be VERY CLOSE to the 640x480 resolution. Save them in a unique folder to load on to your frame. Depending on your version of windows, the text may be different, but the procedure is mostly the same. I do not own a MAC, but I suspect they are fine machines and I'm sure they have a similar, if not easier, way to perform the same function.

If you do not have email access on you computer for whatever reason, there is still a solution. The email window that pops up has all of the photos in the ""Attach"" block. Close or minimize all of the other windows leaving only the draft email open. If it takes up the entire screen, LEFT-CLICK (and release) the ""Restore Down"" button. It is between the red ""X"" (close) button and the minimize button. Now you should be able to see your desktop and the email.

Create a folder on your desktop where you can save the corrected resolution images. Do this with a RIGHT-CLICK (and release) on a blank spot on your desktop. In the window that appears, hover your mouse over, or LEFT-CLICK (and release), the ""New"" line. Then LEFT-CLICK (and release) the ""Folder"" button. You can rename this folder if you wish. If the email block somehow covers the new folder, move either the folder or the email block around until you can see the names of the files in the ""Attach"" block and the new folder you just created. Do this by LEFT-CLICK (AND HOLDING) the top bar of the email block and dragging it around with the mouse. Release it when finished.

IMPORTANT NOTES (IFORMATION ONLY): For the next steps, you will not see the typical ""drag and drop"" features. In addition, the normal copying and pasting features (RIGHT-CLICKING, Control-C, Control-V, etc.) do not work.

LEFT-CLICK (and release) on the name of one the images in the ""Attach"" block. Now press and hold down the CONTROL key. While still holding it down, hit and release the letter ""A"". CASE IS NOT IMPORTANT. Release the CONTROL key. Now all of the images in the ""attachments"" block should be highlighted. LEFT-CLICK AND HOLD on the name of one of the highlighted images. While still holding the LEFT-CLICK key, drag your cursor over the storage folder you created, and then release the LEFT-CLICK button. After a few seconds, the email screen will refresh. The bar at the top will no longer be highlighted. The photos are now copied into the folder you created.

START-UP TIP: Depending on your frame and your PC, your USB might not recognize the frame unless it has been setup first. You do not need to go through a complete setup, just a few steps to start a slideshow with the pre-loaded images. One of the three frames I purchased, one was like this. After the initial setup, this did not recur and there were no other issues. To be clear, this was neither a problem nor a defect.",Exceeded Expectations!

Unfortunately this has not changed. I got these primarily because I was looking for a good set of portable earphones that were NOT sound isolating, and had mic controls for easy pausing of music so I can listen listen to music for the more mundane parts of my office job and still be aware of someone calling me. On that front, these delivered. I got these earbuds because I was hoping the discomfort I got might have been from poorly designed, cheap earbuds of the past, and I really didn't see other design that wasn't sound isolated. However, these still cause discomfort on my left ear and I think this is primarily because I have very small ears, particularly my left ear.
One trade off I was quite expecting was mic positioning. On my other set of in-ears, the mic was low, but came with a clip so positioning was very flexible, especially helpful for clipping to somewhere easy to access. On the P190s, the mic is really high up, so much so that a clip would be useless. So music controls aren't as strong, but the up shot is the mic is right next to your mouth, so mic sound quality gets a bit of a boost, which is already pretty good as well.
As for what makes these good, besides delivering on my usability expectations mentioned above: these have a surprisingly good sound for the price range. I expected a neutral, but dull sound signature. At first I thought the lows might have been a bit shallow, but tight and responsive, but the more I listen, the more I like the sound signature. These aren't dull, but not quite playful or warm either. As another reviewer put it for these the little brother of these (P180), they bring out the quality of the recording. Streaming high quality electronic trance music left me completely immersed, something extremely rare for this form factor. So the bass can be shallow, or it can be deep  depends on the recording, but it has always been tight and responsive, and never overpowering, even in my usual Beastie Boys bass test, especially in Brass Monkey in which the bass will mute the vocals on lesser earphones; the P190s delivered an exceptional listening experience.
These continued to perform well in folk metal as well, where it can be really easy for one of the dozen or so instruments to be drowned out. I listened to Eluveities Brictom, as well as Tegernako.
These met and exceeded my expectations, and are more than adequate. The sound signature lent itself well across vastly different genres of music, from Trance, to Hip-hop, to Celtic Folk Metal.

Turns out that the included small black zip ties and the cable guide things (I don't know the word) worked better for the cables I had to straighten out immediately.  With the leftovers from doing my living room setup, I plan to do my home office.

The larger black cable guide will accommodate a normal PC power cord and HDMI cable just fine.  Squeezing a DVI cable in there in addition was too tight.

The zip ties are very small and lightweight, and you need over an inch of slack pulled through before they'll lock.  There were some strong words mentioned when trying to get a zip tie to lock around a loop of PC speaker wiring that could not be shortened.

The wrap looked about half an inch in diameter, and more than long enough for typical cables behind a single piece of furniture (rather than running between furniture).

Todays date is 7/9/16. This 12 volt adapter has been working without problems for over a year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 11/27/15

So far this power converter has exceeded my expectations. It provides steady 24 hour power to the dash cam (I no longer turn the dash cam off), and still has enough power to charge my tablet. What more could you want?

After reading some of the one star reviews, I have to make three guesses - 1) they received a bad converter, 2) the manufacturer has improved it, or 3) they wired it in wrong, even as simple as it is.

UPDATE 9/6/15

Honda Elements have a glove box in the roof of the car. This let me install one between the metal roof of the car and the head liner.

One line (the one with a mini USB connector goes to a dash cam that I mounted to the back on the rearview mirror.

The full size USB ""extension connector"" is in that glove box.

I've had no problem running the dash cam and charging a tablet at the same time.

For most of this summer the temperature has been in the 90's.

Several time I forgot to remove the dash cam. It was powered all day long without any problems.

Just how hot was it between the sheet metal roof and the headliner? Probably between 120 & 130 degrees.

.
Bad items may slip down the assembly line from time to time. Stuff happens.

If you do happen to get a bad one, I'd say ask for a replacement, because this looks to be a great converter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This device seems to be very well made.

The red & black wires are about five inches long, which is more than adequate for attaching whatever length of wire you may need for your installation. Had it been eight inches long though, I wouldn't have needed to add three more inches. :)  :)  :)

The two other wires measure - USB mini connector = 21.5"", and the USB extension = 13"".

Although most of my devices will use the USB mini connector, some don't. So the USB ""extension"" cable end gives me tremendous flexibility.

.
I bought two, one for the side of the dashboard between the dashboard & the drivers door. The box is inside. The wires stick through the side. A rubber grommet keeps the wire ends from falling inside, but lets me push the wires into the dashboard cavity when not needed.

The electronic ""box"" is small enough to hide under the headliner next to the dome light. This one will power the dash cam mounted to the rearview mirror.

.
Be aware that if you have no idea on how to connect this to your car's wiring system, you may cause damage to the power adapter, or your car.

Get an experienced installer to connect it inside your car if you have any doubts.

.
Otherwise, if you know what DC means and you have a multimeter, installing this can be child's play.

Simpler still - the metal body of the vehicle is ""ground"", attach the black wire to a metal part of your car.

The wires going to a light will be ""positive"", connect the red wire to that.",This device seems to be very well made. The ...,1430179200,

Just the opposite. Each and every CF reader broke within weeks or a month at the longest and every time while I was on assignment and HAD to down load photos to my MacBook Pro Retina in order to keep shooting my cameras for the assignments for NBC News/Sports, ESPN, National Geographic and several other magazines.
Each time the internal prongs on the CF card reader bent or broke making it impossible to make a connection with the memory card. Fortunately I was surrounded by other networks and photojournalists and was able to borrow their card readers.
I kept replacing the readers with the same model thinking it was a fluke of POOR workmanship. No.
Finally I purchased a superior reader that reads everything with the exception of the new C-Fast cards. The CF reader (in particular) is made in a way that the cards are well guided and supported on loading well BEFORE they get to the pins that make the connections, thereby making it all but impossible to have a failure.
After the second purchase and especially after the 3rd failure of the EXACT same problem I contacted the company through Amazon and was told: ""These things happen and you just have to replace the item...""
I urge you, if your a hobbyist or especially a professional who counts on a card reader for your job, DO NOT waste your money, time or hopes on what has truly proven to be a poorly designed and even a poorer made card reader when it comes to the CF slot.

After a lot of looking I narrowed the search to one of the Sony DSC-RX100 series cameras or the Canon Powershot GX7.  I chose the Sony RX100II over the Canon Powershot because it was much lighter and had a better built-in flash per reviews.  It didn't hurt that it was also available for about $100 less.  Having now had a few weeks to play with it, I have found nothing to make me second guess my choice.  The full auto mode works great indoors and out in bright and dim light.  In that mode it is really an ""almost pocket sized"" point and shoot but with much better quality and lighting range than any of the true pocket cameras.  If you want more control over the shooting process there are several other modes up to and including full manual that work well.  Video capability didn't have much to do with my decision, but my limited experience with it so far has shown it to be very acceptable.  There's a bit of a learning curve to mastering the menu system, but it is actually quite logical once you spend a little time with it.  The Operating Manual was a big help for this, especially after I printed it out.  This is a great camera for what it was designed to be.  If interchangeable lenses and two pounds of camera hanging around your neck is your cup of tea, head for a true SLR.",I chose the Sony RX100II over the Canon Powershot because it was much lighter and had a better built-in flash per reviews,1457913600,

2406016,1,12,True,"02 14, 2013",A1F1A0QQP2XVH5,B0068DTASQ,,Mark B,"I travel 50% for business and really need an easy to carry, functional bag.  Things that are important to me include comfort, ease of access to my phone. computer, and papers, and TSA-readiness.  And, of course, it has to look professional. The Command bag does great in most of these areas, but could use a little improvement in some areas too.  Here is my quick run-down, as well as some things I wish other reviewers would have detailed better.

COMFORT
The bag is comfortable and balanced, but I do highly recommend the optional deluxe strap pad.  The smaller shoulder pad that comes with the bag is too small and digs into your shoulder with larger loads.  The optional pad is pricey, but worth it.  The bag handle is minimalist but functional.  Comfortable enough to carry briefly, but not designed to carry a heavy bag in your hand for a long time.  The shoulder strap is key to the comfort of this bag.

SIZE
I bought the medium.  I own a 13"" MacBook Air and a full-size iPad.  The MB Air fits into the computer compartment with room to spare.  The iPad fits in the nice, felted iPad slot in the same compartment.  The two do not touch metal to metal at all.  My iPad has the Apple magnetic cover but no case.  It just fits into the iPad slot.  If you have any case of size, you may not be able to close the iPad's slot's velcro.  This is not a problem unless you have the computer zipper open and turn your bag sideways.  In that case, you iPad will slide right out.

TRAVEL-EASE
The bag does okay in this area, but IMHO does not excel.  You can unzip the computer compartment from the bottom so that the bag ""butterflies"", isolating the computer compartment. Keep in mind, however, that the iPad stay in the computer compartment too, so TSA may ask you to remove the iPad.  This happened to me once. An actually, I find it a lot easier to actually remove the laptop (you can access through a zipper opening on the bag without opening the whole bag) rather than unzipping threes sides of the case, staying it on the belt and then re-zipping it on the other side.  It takes me 1/4 of the time to just take the laptop out.  There is a large pass-thorugh area on the back of the bag so that you can loop the bag through handle of a roller bag.  A nice point is that if you decide not to use the TRSA- friendly butterfly feature, you can actually use the space between the laptop compartment and the main bag compartment as a place to store files, papers, etc.  You can access it by unzipping one of the sides of the TSA zippers.  Also, if you choose not to use the pass-through for your roller bag handle, this pass-thoguh actually becomes an additional pocket since it is sealed with a long strip of velcro at the bottom.  It turns out to be another great place for easy access to papers, etc.  I actually keep my Kindle in there.  It does not seal on the top, so keep that in mind.  The one thing this bag is missing for travelers is an easy place to put your boarding pass, sunglasses, and other minor incidentals.  They could easily add a narrow pocket on the front flap.  I bought the 3Way add-on for my iPhone.  This goes on the strap and gives very easy access to my phone.  Otherwise, there is no good, easy-to-access place for your phone to go.

STRAPS and ACCESS
You have two options for securing the main compartment.  Once is using the hooks you see in the stock photo. The other is velcro.  Of course you could use both.  I prefer the hooks, mainly because Velcro is so loud to pull apart.  I hate going into a meeting and tearing open my bag with that velcro noise.  It is bothersome and comes across very cheap-ish.  Unlike some other reviewers, I have not had any trouble at all with the two hooks coming loose during the normal course of travel.  The hooks are just that; small hooks with one side open.  To secure them, you hook a loop built into the bags's flap, and then cinch them down.  They look good in my opinion.  The velcro is disabled via a strip that covers the velcro up.  You can take the strip off and store it somewhere (the velcro disabling strips are not attached to the bag, so take care not to lose them!).  I love the fact that you can choose between the professional-looking and quiet straps, and the more secure but loud velcro.  The shoulder strap is easy to adjust and has a large clip that releases the strap's tension (makes the strap longer) to ease getting the bag off of you if you like to where it across your chest and back. Near that large clip is a large tension lever that allows you to very quickly change the tension (length) of the shoulder strap.  As I mentioned earlier, I added the optional shoulder pad and the 3way phone puch to my strap.  Both fit perfecly well, look good, and add a lot of comfort and functionality to the strap.

STORAGE
There are a number of pockets, all of which are fairly shallow.  When you lift up the front flap, there are three zippered pockets.  These do not expand very much anbd, when filled, tends to interfere with the available space of the other pockets.  The top pocket has a long red strip with a clasp at the end for your keys or a biker's light.  I keep my keys and gun in here.  The second pocket down is where I keep my compact camera.  The thrid pcokect is for SD cards and business cards.  IT won't hold much more than that.  Just above the zippered pockets is a non-zippered, non-velcroed pouch where you could put a boarding pass, gum, or snacks.  Finally, there is another zippered pouch that you access form the right that goes in behind all of these.  It;'s a nice 5""x11"" area that is not easy to see, so I keep my passport, travel papers, and other important paper items in there.  Lots of great storage options, all non very expandable, but I managed to find a nice place for every thing I typically like to have with me.  The main compartment is divided in to.  The smaller front pouch could be used for a kindle, headphones, or a book.  The man compartment divider has a zippered pouch which is where I keep things like aspirin, gum, a brush, etc.  It's a large pocket (7""x9"") and I like that is is zippered and private, but easily accessible form the top of the bag.  It is expandable at the expense of the front pocket I just mentioned, and the main compartment which is next.  So the main compartment is large.  You could fit binders, big headphones, another computer, folders, books, etc. in there.  For the medium bag, it measures 14""w x 4""d x 10""h.  It is not divided, so whatever you put in there will get all mingled.  On the front side of the compartment there are three large pen holders, a 4""x5"" velcro pocket and a  3""x4"" unsecured (no zipper/no velcro) pocket.  I keep my MiFi in the middle velco pocket, and my iPad charger in the unsecured pocket.  The pen holders can hold two pens each.  There is  no super-obvious place for business cards in this area, however. I think they should sew a business card pocket in there somewhere.  Finally, there is a charge pocket at the botom of the bag that runs the length of the bag.  Unless you toss your charges into the main compartment, the bottom compartment really is about the only place for charges any bigger than an iPhone/iPad charger.  I keep my MiFi charger and Mac charge in there.  It is tight and it takes away from the main compartment storage at the bottom.  You also have to keep in mind that the weight of the entire bag will be sitting on whatever is in the bottom compartment.  The charger compartment is accessed from the front of the bag under a flap below the Timbuk2 logo.

CONCLUSION
So that's the bag overview.  I like it a lot and it has worked well, other than some minor points I mentioned above.  It is definitely a keeper for those that like to be organized.  I had been using a small North Face backpack prior to buying this, so it has been an adjustment in that you can toss stuff everywhere in the large compartments of the NOrth Face street bag.  Using the Command Messenger takes some additional planning and organization in the placement of your items.  Wonderful bag that is becoming part of my travel life.  Highly recommended!","(Review of Medium size by a frequent business traveller)  Great bag.  Functional, sturdy, and great for travel",1360800000,

I plugged this into my motherboard after exhausting all of the built-in SATA connectors. Note that this board is a PCIe x2 card. Most motherboards have one or two long PCIe x16 slots for video cards, and one or two PCIe x1 slots for low-bandwidth devices that nobody cares about anymore because those devices are all integrated into the motherboard to begin with.

I had to plug this into a PCIe x16 video card slot. Being a file server, I was using the built-in APU anyway, so I had the slot open. Keep this in mind before you buy. There are motherboards with PCIe slots between x1 and x16, but those are not common.

Also keep in mind that SATA III has more bandwidth than a PCIe x1 slot: there are a few boards similar to this but x1 instead of x2, and they will never reach SATA III speeds. SATA III is between the two PCIe speeds. If you want to maximize your SATA III speed, you NEED this board. Note that unless you are using SSDs, you are unlikely to sustain full SATA III bandwidth anyway, but why hamstring yourself?

My server runs Kubuntu Linux 14.04. I plugged in this card and two hard drives and started it up. The BIOS detected the new hard drives: it listed them at boot, but it cannot see them in setup. Regardless, it was able to see them. Once booted into Linux, I was able to see the new hard drives no problem.

It has three shooting definitions, which will determine the length of time you can shoot video:

720p (lower quality)- 4 hours
720p (higher quality)- 3 hours
1080p (highest quality)- 2 hours

You can also take 12.8 megapixel still photos using a camera setting or by pressing a button WHILE YOU ARE SHOOTING VIDEO!

There is also up to a 4x zoom that can be moved in and out while you are shooting.  Plus it's HD and can easily be connected directly to a computer with the USB connecter that snaps out or by using a HDMI mini cable (not included).

Best yet - you don't need to purchase a memory card as this has 8GB of memory built right in!

Like most cameras, the video gets a little bit grainy when in full-zoom mode, but at all other times is excellent quality.  The touch controls are self-explanatory and easy to use.  The camera has a quick start and fits easily into a pocket or case.  LOVE it and my son has had excellent success with it - either by carrying it around to shoot or by mounting it on a tripod.

I do, however, recommend a good quality screen protector as the touch screen, with a lot of use, may tend to get scratched.",Can't believe the quality for the price!!!,1325462400,

I decided it was time to get a new router and found this one while searching for dual band routers.  I have a smart Vizio TV so I figured for the extremely cheap price I'd give it a shot.  I expected some headaches with setting up but I was pleasantly surprised I didn't have any problems.  Logged into the router and set up the 5 and 2.4 GHz networks to my SSIDs and the security pass phrases.  I put my TV on the 5 GHz network along with one of the laptops and a couple others/phones on the 2.4 GHz.  No problems so far after a few days of running.  I also tried out the USB port with a hard drive and was pleased to see it works nicely as well (make sure you use FAT32 format and not NTFS to have read/write capability).

Updated on 9/9/13 - Like many of the other reviews this router has proven to be junk.  It drops connections daily (though my laptop will say it's connected there's no internet) which requires turning the router off and on.  Even my Vizio smart TV which this router is optimized for and is the sole device on the 5Ghz channel loses internet connection. It fails to do the main thing a router does which is assign IPs and keep a routing table.  Instead it constantly assigns IPs already in use.  I had to go to static IPs on my few laptops to avoid it.  Don't buy this router.  The good news is if you are stuck using this router there's DD-WRT firmware for it which will fix the problems with Vizio's awful firmware.",Seems to be a good router,1377129600,

Pros:
Build: it is built well and sturdy.  It feels like it can handle a beating.  It's strong yet lightweight.  The cord feels thick and I doubt it tears easily with constant maneuvering.
Function: Works perfectly.  Plug it into your computer and then plug whatever USB devices you need to.  There is an LED blue glow around the buttons/switches which turn on when the corresponding USB port is activated.  The glow disappears when it is switched off.
Compatibility: So far, every USB device has connected without any difficulty.  Connection remains strong without disconnecting randomly.

Cons:
Buttons can easily be pressed.  There is basically no security measure to prevent it from being pressed accidentally.

This is my first venture into the world of graphics cards and it has for certain been a learning experience.
I paid what I considered big money for this and fully expected my experience with it to be problem-free for years to come.
First, let me be clear that I am not a ""gamer""; I bought this card purely due to the fact that some of my photo editing programs were overwhelming the integrated graphics.
To be fair, with this card installed, most of the programs that I was having problems with will now work fine.
However, several times each day, completely random and for no particular reason, my screen will go black for a few seconds and then come back on.
When the screen returns, a message appears stating that ""nvidia etc., etc..... has failed and has now recovered""
Most times this has been only a worrisome annoyance; however, when it happens during involved editing of a photo, it causes the program to shut-down and all work/time is lost, causing me to have to start over.
Today, I had a photo opened in one of my programs and had spent about three hours meticulously making some reparations; then, just as I had the ""save as"" box up on the screen and about to click ""save"", in that split second, the screen went black for about five seconds; and, when it recovered, my program had crashed, losing everything I had done, and I had to start over.
I had already been in communication with nvidia via ""support tickets""; then, after about the fifth ticket, when I click ""submit ticket"", I get an invidia screen that says it was unable to process my request.
I have uninstalled and reinstalled drivers several times, tried different versions of drivers, jumped through hoops and burning rings of fire, and I am no better off than I was.
If I were paid one dollar per hour for the time I have invested in trying to get this situation resolved, I could have bought this card in the clear and money enough for two more.
Who knows, maybe invidia will do something that will fix this issue and I will come back with a flattering review ............ I sure hope so.
 I dislike being disappointed in something that I had confidence in.
I wish I had read all of the one and two star reviews before making my purchase.

My main beef with it is that it's not especially intuitive to use.  And, the buttons along the side and back of the unit are too discreet and easily pressed when holding it to set the alarm, causing me to do stuff I didn't mean to do.  Without a bright light, you can't see what their functions are.

Being able to program 2 different alarm times AND separate weekend times are terrific features.  I also love the automatic time set and daylight savings time adjustment.  No more worrying about forgetting to change the clock twice a year.

Unlike some reviewers, I don't find the brightness of the clock to be too bright.  I keep it on its dimmest setting and that's perfect.

Given the size of the unit, the sound is decent.  I didn't really expect much from it in terms of high fidelity and don't plan on listening to my iPod through it much.  Its main use is to be able to wake up to music or podcasts that I've chosen.  I'm not even that worried about its ability to pick up FM stations, though it does that reasonably well.  Without an AM antenna hooked up, I can't receive any AM stations.  That's a total non issue for me, as I never listen to AM these days.

So far, I've found that my 3rd generation 30GB iPod, 5th generation 80GB iPod, new 160GB iPod, and 2nd generation iPod Touch all work perfectly in the dock and with the supplied remote.

In all, once I get accustomed to the placement of the buttons and how to set the alarm, it will serve my needs just fine.",Does the job.,1258848000,

Canon has better sound with video recording, less noise, better detail in shadows.  I wanted to like the fx30, I really did.  The wide angle was promising, but I held both cameras with the same settings side by side and took a lot of pictures to compare and the Canon wins every shot.  Even with the anti-shake on the FX30, the shots came out blurry.  The Canon Sd1000 has no anti-shake but the pictures are much better. The final straw was when taking a video the sound on the fx30 just couldn't be heard when played back on the computer. Sd1000 sound was crisp, loud and clear. Seriously, read the reviews... if you have not used the Canon sd series you may think the fx series is great, but once you use a Canon you will notice the difference right away.

They fit well, don't move around or fall off if I bend over.  I had to find something that I could wear over hearing aids, and these do the trick.  I won't be able to test them on an airplane for a year because I don't fly much, but just sitting in my apartment, I don't hear traffic or neighbors which is what I want so I can sit on my deck and read without being distracted by their conversations.  The headphones were easy to pair with my cell phone which is where I have all my music and radio apps.  While I was testing it I got a phone call (which was spam) and I declined it.  Then I got a notification for voicemail so I called my voicemail and everything worked clearly and on cue.  The phone and notification interrupted the music, which is what it should do, but it just paused it and picked up right where it left off when I was done on the phone.  :)

At first I thought it wasn't very loud and kept getting a beep when I tried to make it louder, but then I checked the volume on my phone and adjusted it there, and could make it louder or softer through the controls on my phone.  I turned the headphones off by mistake and when I turned them back on, since my phone was still on and in music mode, it picked up with the same song where it left off.  It will take some getting used to feeling where the control buttons are, but they are separate buttons with a space in between so it's easier to find.  Two other headphones I tried had all the controls next to each other and it was hard to tell which one I was pushing.

I can't read or concentrate when people around me are talking, so I'll be glad to have these with me when I go to camp this Summer, to block out the conversations when I'm off duty ad want to read.

In order to have duplicate TV's (one in the kitchen and the main TV), I needed this device.  It worked fine, but I also needed a 5-port HDMI switcher in front of it.  This allowed me to split the switcher output to my receiver and to the remote TV with over 25 feet of HDMI cable (an active type of cable by monoprice).  I have several intermediate connections (wall jacks, 3' HDMI cables between connections, etc and have no quality degradation.

My only complaint is that I wish all of the connections were on one side to make mounting in an AV system easy.  Right now it just lays behind the entertainment center unorganized and ugly with the rest of my rats nest, unlike my switcher which has all rear inputs and is a clean install and sits on top of the cable box.

I think this device is identical to others I have seen that are sometimes twice the price.  I think there is a vendor that sells them and different OEM's put their name on them.  Look carefully - they're too similar to be coincidence.  As a result I bought this one because it was cheaper.

I did find that because I am splitting my signal before it goes to my receiver, there is an audio delay between the receiver and the remote TV.  This is not a fault of the splitter, but a difference in how fast the receiver processes the sound compared to the remote TV.  Fortunately I have an audio delay feature on the receiver to counteract this issue.  Be aware if you're expecting sound from two different devices as they may not be in sync.","Works great, would like to see one with all connectors on one side.",1454371200,

Well worth the increased cost from a pair of $25ish Blimark earbuds I bought prior to these (returned them immediately). Easy to use instructions, and you get a nice little English woman whispering in your ear on startup, connection, and shutdown. Paired easily with my MPOW Streambot transmitter/receiver. I use these to run on the treadmill, and the Streambot hooks right up to the 3.5mm headphone jack so I can watch TV when I'm not gasping for breath and checking for signs of a heart-attack. This setup also allows me to frantically wave my arms around in front of me like an idiot without fear of ripping a wired earbud out.

I keep them charged so I cannot speak as to the battery live, but I have had no issues with a little over an hour of use. The range is good, I have clear sound even about 20ft if I break for a drink. Sound quality is good if you wear them properly. They can loosen in your ear a bit after some jolting, but they have never fallen out.

I ordered this item Friday afternoon. When I returned home today (Monday), the package was leaning against my door.

This is a good replacement; it fit perfectly and was a snap to install. I assume it is an OEM part. I haven't seen anything to make me think otherwise. The action is just as delicate and accurate as was my original keyboard. The old keyboard had seen too many miles, and finally started producing wrong characters or no characters when I pressed certain keys.

The installation of this keyboard, from opening the package it came in to being able to type on it, was about five minutes.

There's only one thing different from my old keyboard. The original keyboard was silver.

Again, excellent service from Amazon, a great product, and a vendor who delivers QUICKLY!

*EDIT* I said I'd come back and give my ""down the road"" impressions, so here I am. The date today is 10 AUG 11.

This product still deserves five stars... no sticking keys, no flaws in manufacture (that I have detected thus far), and it appears to be the real deal... a DELL OEM replacement part that has lived up to the advertising; and I am not even a big fan of DELL products in general.

But, they are not clear in the mids and don't have much in the higher ranges, they seem to just fade off.  They seem to have just a little in the lower range but I have not tested them yet.  I was disappointed with how they were not even as clear as the Daytons (which only cost me $25 for the pair!).  They are a little smaller, which was nice, but they are just not as clear and as bright in the mids as i thought they would be.  There is no crispness and they get even muddier with higher volume.

My needs for the notebook are very humble, to run 2 simple programs, that I don't use heavily.  Beyond Windows and Vista being junk, my dislike for the Dell is the keys.  They don't respond well, and I either mistype a great deal, or they simply are not registering the keystroke at all, and so a lot of time is wasted. I've owned 2 prior notebooks, IBM's, but those were bought about 10 years ago.  I'm not up on what other current notebooks are like, but the Dell leaves me unimpressed.  For my simple needs, of occasional use, it's inexpensive and compact, and so I'll keep it.  But, having owned several Dell desktops for the last 10 years, the notebooks do not measure up.

Other dislikes: the DVD tray seems incredibly flimsy and fragile. It doesn't eject well, and it can get hung up very easily with seemingly paper thin objects near its path.  The screen display has poor contrast, and I've yet to figure out how to improve on it other than dimming the brightness which doesn't fix the contrast itself.  Maybe that's Windows sloppiness, and not Dell, I don't know.

The start-up on a cold boot also seems slow at least compared to my old Dell desktop, and especially to the Macs.  2 USB ports are stacked on top of each other and depending on the thickness of the gadgets can block each other.

I also find it hard to open the case. Maybe I have too clunky fingers, but the other notebooks I've used had a more tactile latch and point to grasp.  And the shiny cover, all pretty and glossy for the first few seconds, is rapidly covered with fingerprints which detract from its appearance.

Everything was fine loading the stick, but when I tried to use it on my vacation today it was DOA.  Now I am sitting on vacation with my kids and all of their videos are inaccessible. I'd gladly pay for VOD fees but there is no Internet connection here besides my phone.  Thanks Transcend!  The eight hour flight was AWESOME thanks to your incompetence and the next ten days should be even better.  Maybe you can send me that RMA number via smoke signal.

After using my Samsung HD-941 DVD player for 2 years ($200+ when it first came out), I figured that it was time to swap it out with something else after enduring a couple of its annoying shortcomings.

The most impressive is the crisp picture quality. The unit processes dark shades without the annoying pixelation, which bugged me to no end with the Samsung. Another observation is that my picture was much sharper with the new player.

For the more savvy in A/V electronics: So far, I have played Xvids, AVIs, Mpegs, and also normal DVDs. It plays just about everything except .ogm (I think there were a couple more formats, but I am not 100% sure). That was the key reason for me in purchasing the Philips. You can also unlock the player to make it region free. Just search the web for ""unlocking dvp5982"" and follow the instructions. Another cool thing is that the unit reads multisession discs, which saves everyone a lot of money in the long run if you are a burner like I am.

A small gripe that I have is that the until does not have optical audio out. Because of my strange A/V setup, I cannot use HDMI for audio from the unit. Just a heads up...

The Philips DVP5982 is tiny, which is nice. It feels a bit tacky, but Philips did a great job of using shiny plastics to spruce it up in the looks department. I appreciate that it does not have any annoying, super-bright LEDs on the front to distract you while viewing movies.

Another feature of note is that the player can process 1080p, which is great since videos are starting to be distributed in higher quality formats.

Now for the remote: It is laid out fairly well. The reason I say ""fairly"" is that when I do grab it in the right way, all the buttons are where I expect them to be. On the other hand, I have had occasions of holding it upside down (I think the jog buttons should have been on the bottom). I had read some other reviews stating that the remote does not have a button to open the tray door. If they would have read the manual, they would learn that the stop button doubles for eject.",Such A Bargain...,1195344000,

In most smart phone and tablet devices, the mini USB port is located at the bottom. So when you stand your device up in portrait mode, when the mini usb plug extrudes out of the port on the bottom of the device, this stand does not work. This due to the design of it not being raised at least 3"" for the plug.

instead, you have to use the device in landscape mode which can be a problem, especially if the user interface of the device (like a phone) is meant to be used in portrait (answering calls, dialing out, etc.).

This stand does not support large tablets well. For example, my original Apple iPad 1 is too big for it and this will cause it to flop over. if I prop it up in portrait mode. It will work in landscape mode. But the amount of surface coverage to prop it up is small. So I wouldn't recommend using this for large tablets.

- I messed up a ""bit"", and there's a single bubble (probably random dust that fell while I was applying), and it bubbled at the edge of the top (will expain!).
----------------
This will totally depend on your tastes towards screen protectors and whether or not you've experience a matte screen protector before.
----------------
Matte qualities: its what a normal screen matte screen protector does, reduce glare, low oils, and consistent surface. Also, well the reduced clarity of whites (its creates this polarization).
- It does not however reduce brightness and color clarity overall due to its glare reduction.
----------------
Protector: it feels pretty good against the hand when swiping and in use, does not seem to reduce responsiveness either. However, it does not reach edge to edge of the device, it can't. The device has contoured edges so it's harder for a screen protector to attach to it, especially on such a small surface for a display only protector.
- Apply this slightly under the ear piece, not directly aligning it (it will bubble off that top portion, not too big a deal).
- Its different from my Tech Armor protectors, they have a much smoother feel, less catch to the screen.. will take a few days to get used to, it becomes unnnoticeable.","Pretty good, but it depends.",1359849600,

It was easy to put into a PCIe slot on my Falcon Northwest

smoothly, as did the automatic on line registration and
update. The card has been working flawlessly since.

I needed a discrete sound card because the integrated
sound card (Realtek) on my FragBox could not be detected
when running Ubuntu 10.04 inside a VMware virtual machine, although it was detected when running Windows XP
inside a VMware virtual machine.

To my pleasant surprise, the SB1356 card was detected and
used properly by Ubuntu 10.04 inside a virtual machine,
though in a 3.1 speaker setup instead of my 5.1 speaker
setup. This downgrade of speaker setup took place also
for Windows XP in a virtual machine, both before and after I installed the SB1356 card, so I am going to

Soon this very expensive high end music player will be useless to me when I can't get streaming service apps to work. Sony is a ""fire and forget"" company.

I ordered this mouse during Anker's anniversary promotion after reading positive reviews from people who, like me, suffer from RSI or Carpel Tunnel injury to their ""mousing"" hand from years of computer use. I had switched from using a conventional mouse to using a trackball in an effort to alleviate some of the pain I have been experiencing. This worked for a time, but I was again feeling a lot of pain in my hand and wrist - but now in a different location.

Enter the Anker Ergonomic Vertical Mouse. This is the latest version of their vertical mouse and is something I had never tried before. I ordered one on sale and was looking forward to giving it a try in the hope that it would help my hand. A few days later it arrived and I took it to work - only to be disappointed because the mouse was DOA. It was getting no power from any batteries I placed inside. Bummer.

Rather than return it to Amazon and write a snarky review, I chose to contact AnkerDirect Customer Service with the problem. I had a similar experience with an Anker speaker I purchased a few months ago (you can find my review of the product on the Anker SoundCore Sport XL page) that had problems. I also contacted AnkerDirect Customer Service and was pleased with how quickly they resolved the problem, leaving me a happy and, most importantly, returning customer. The Customer Support Representative (CSR) was super friendly and took care of the problem with minimal hassle. I was told to keep / dispose of the dead mouse and that they would ship me another asap. They did too! Within a couple of days I had my replacement and it works great.

I don't think I have giant hands, but they are large. Yet my mouse-hand fits comfortably on the Anker mouse. I like the ergonomic contour and design. I have not had any problems with the placement of the dpi switch (as other reviewers have commented). But I will say that the left-mouse-button is not as sensitive as I would like (sometimes causing me to have to click more than once to get the command completed). I've been using it daily for the past few weeks and it seems to be helping me a bit. Getting used to a vertical mouse was not a big deal and it seemed natural after a couple of hours use. It is still a mouse though and I think my hand pain will just be a part of me as long as I use computers. But it does seem to provide me with some measure of relief. I would recommend others to give it a try, but realize it is probably not going to be a cure-all for computer-based RSI injuries.

Overall I am quite happy with my purchase and with AnkerDirect Customer Service.

UPDATE 10/6/16:
After using the mouse daily for the past few weeks I have need to add this update. I am finding that the mouse, as some other reviewers have commented, is indeed to small for my hands. the ""little finger"" rest isn't large enough to add any support do I end-up mousing with my pinky extended (think drinking all posh with the extended pinky and you get the idea). After a couple of hours it really hurts! So I am now inclined to say that people with smaller hands may find this mouse useful. But I think those who, like me, have large hands will find the mouse uncomfortable after a few days of this.",Great ergonomic mouse backed by excellent customer service.,1475020800,

I have to return this though.  As noted way down in these reviews and not noticed by me before buying, having one of these cameras on your network will knock some AirPlay speakers offline (I am using iHome iW1s).  It's not Wi-Fi interference, it's something in the camera firmware sending packets that cause the AirPlay speakers problems.

I've decided to keep the card for more time. Obviously, this has been the worst decision in my life. While doing an extended play session, the PC froze and restarted. Then after it came back, it defaulted to the basic resolution 800x600 and basic display driver. Only one monitor works.

Within the first 6 images, I was stunned at the contrast, the detail, from ten feet away, I could count eyelashes. Opening in LR3.6 and zooming in, I could easily see skin pores. I'm used to having to bump the saturation or sharpness on the Canon lenses, but OOC (out of camera) with the Sigma, they were awesome. No CA to be found either.

The lens is quiet, contrary to some's opinion, the zoom ring rotates backwards to a Canon, have to get used to that. The OS is almost deadly silent. No, the focus ring won't move if the AF is turned on, that requires a clutch and those are one the $1000+ L (pro) lenses. The included hood was a nice touch, thanks Sigma. The OS (optical stabilization), doesn't seem quite as forgiving as the Canon, so a missed shot here is there isn't a biggie. I intentionally took some shots with the Sun on the edge, and no flaring to be seen. On a 1.6 crop body, an EOS series, this becomes aprroxx 280MM on the big end. It seems to really shine at f8+. But does has some nice creamy Bokah, around the middle zoom, if you can place the background far enough behind the subject, say 30 feet+ or so. But it's not a 50MM f1.8 either lol. They make some luscious bokah using the same technique.

I was steered away from Sigma when I fist started photography, two years ago, and I'm a fanboy now. Wow, thanks. I'm pleasantly surprised and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to another photographer. 5 stars for value and performance.

Update Sep 10th 2012
This lens continues to surprise me. I did comparison shoots between my Canon 55-250 and this one today. Big difference on contrast and saturation. The Sigma looked richer, with nicer spread between lighter and darker areas (contrast). The Canon, looked slightly washed out, I even took more shots with the Canon, thinking I didn't have the exposure exactly the same, nope, washed out, no doubt. I did lose 50mm of zoom with the Sigma, but plan on buying a teleconverter for the future, in case I need it. I can't do this on the Canon Ef-s lens. I would probably rate the Canon as an 7 or 8, but this one is for sure, a 9, with an L lens being an absolute 10. I have done direct Sun shots in the morning and only had one image that had a slight flare. This has 8 blades in it and makes some nice Sun rays. 8 blades will give you nice bokeh also. Tested that also, very nice indeed.

Bottom line, I wish I would have had this along time ago, instead of the Canon. Live and learn huh.",Stunned at the detail and quality,1345161600,

Depth of field is easy to control, giving you the ability to blur out background, foreground, or all surroundings to your focal point.

Instructions were clear... simply power off DVR, plug in the included 3ft eSATA cable, power up the drive then power up the DVR.

DVR then starts up and formats the new drive (about 15 seconds).

This drive takes over as the new Hard Drive for all recordings and the other drive vanishes (as expected and documented).  That said, all of your searches, lists and recording schedules are not available and you must reset them.  Also, because you are starting fresh, it takes awhile for the guide to fill in.

Records with the quality of the original and has the same response time.

Only a nit but wish they had put the power LED in the front instead of toward the back.

About a day old but happy so far and looking forward to NOT having to delete things all the time as I did with the standard drive.

Also, I have to thank Amazon for the free and fast super-saver shipping.  Very much appreciated!

I do not regret at all. I have already taken around a thousand pictures and the image quality is amazing. The camera is terrific: perfect weight, great viewfinder, excellent AF and controls are easy to understand and to get accustomed to. The 18-135 Zoom is very good, kind of a perfect walk-around lens for the K5 II, tough it has showed some CA (purple fringe) in a few pictures.
The build quality of the camera and of the lens is really impressive - old-Pentax style: I still have my Pentax KX (1975), and tough I have not used it for years, it still works fine. Build like a tank! And my old Non-AF Pentax lenses work on the K-5 II...
If you are not bound to Nikon or Canon or Sony, etc., because of lenses and other related equipments, and want to move to a new DSLR, build with quality (not plastic...) for a reasonable price,  I do suggest you to try the Pentax K-5 II.

For the last two years, I've used almost exclusively the Western Digital Green drives. Perhaps a half dozen each of the 750gb, 1tb, 1.5tb drives. They've been fantastic for data storage.

When the 2tb version reached the right price point, I ordered a couple of those. I was aware of the issues with sector size, detection, and formatting in Windows, but I use Solaris, Linux, and OSX almost exclusively. These drives were being used in OSX, which does have support for these drives.

However, when I plugged both drives in, I had a hell of a time formatting them through the Disk Utility and had to do it manually on the command line.

The real problems began after the drives were formatted and I had moved a ton of data to them. On one of the drives, I renamed a folder which contained about 1.25tb of data. Instantly, the folder disappeared and the drive appeared empty. That's right. I renamed the folder all my data was in and that magically deleted all my content.

Upon closer inspection, the data was still there - it just didn't appear in the file system. Thankfully, I was able to recover the data with some command-line-fu. I then reformatted the drive and gave it a torture test until the time I had to get these back in the box to return to Amazon before the refund period expired. I found boh of the drives to be questionable, but the one drive above to be particularly bad. It could have been just a bad drive or it could be a consistent problem across all of the 2tb WD Greens. My test sample (two drives) isn't adequate to extrapolate.

I will say that the experience was enough to drive me away from the 2tb version. I've instead gone back to buying the 1.5tb WD Greens and replaced both 2tb drives with three of those.

I don't believe the EARS vs EADS version has anything to do with it as I've been using the 1.5tb versions for a long time now and that includes both EARS and EADS drives. They have been stable and I have never had any issues with them.

I've had good experiences until recently with Western Digital's drives, but I'm too gun-shy from the latest experience to try their 2tb drives again any time soon. Back to the trusty 1.5tbs.

Update: I wrote this review the first week of June and as of the second week of August, I have been running a few 2tb WD EARS drives exclusively in a pair of Drobos (as I mention in further replies to this review, the company behind Drobo sell exclusively WD green drives to meet thermal and power needs for their devices). I've had four 2tb WD EARS running in a single Drobo for more than a month now without any of the problems that I experienced on the other 2TB WD EARS that I used. I'm not sure if this is due to how the Drobo interfaces with and utilizes the drives (and compensates for the slow response times, perhaps?) or if there has been some improvement in newer productions of the drive, or if some of us just had a bad batch (the newest drives were purchased from another leading online tech retailer. Think chicken reproduction...).

At any rate, I am not sure I'll trust these drives directly in a system or as attached storage other than part of a dedicated Drobo-type system. They may be fine for that use (as I've said before, I can only comment on my personal experiences and observed experiences of other people with this drive), but I'm not willing to risk it since we're talking about large amounts of data.

My continued advice based on my latest experiences are that you should still consider these drives, but ONLY if you are aware of and willing ot accept the possibility that you may have to deal with returning/exchanging/replacing your drives. As always, Amazon treats customers very well when they have problems with products -- so as long as you can take the time and effort to do that if you encounter severe drive issues with these, then perhaps the nice price on these will be worth it.",Not worth the trouble; Returned my drives.,1275436800,

I took close-up pictures of where all the cables were positioned before removing anything, and I'm really glad I did because I couldn't have remembered and been able to reassemble all components correctly if I hadn't. In the process of this I removed and opened the Powerman unit so to clean the fan while the motherboard was out. After cleaning and replacing the unit I fitted the backplate into the underside of the motherboard and screwd it back into place then was able to apply thermal paste before fitting the cooler and closing up the PC.

I opened the battery box to find a small set of cheap screwdrivers, a battery, and a sheet of directions instructing me not to shoot, burn, hit-with-a-hammer, et cetera the battery.  There were no instructions for installation, but those are easy enough to find and I had already had the system apart a few times anyway.  I looked at the battery, and my first response was *this cannot be right*, and then *it does not look right*.

I shut down the laptop, laid it on its cover, and removed the bottom with one of the little screwdrivers.  The battery was right up front, and I removed it with another of the screwdrivers.  In a couple of minutes, I had the old battery out.  I was wrong, it was exactly the correct battery  but it was hard to tell since the old battery was significantly swollen.

The new battery slipped right in  it is a bit of a trick to get the connector attached whilst holding the battery up, but not hard.  Three screws and it was mounted.  The cover was quickly attached, and within 10 minutes from the start it was all finished.

The battery came mostly charged (I have read that half-charge is the best way to store them).  Plugged up and powered up, everything is nominal.  My touchpad now works ever-so-much better without the battery trying to push it out of the case.  The EFI reports the correct capacity, cycle counts, et cetera.  No problems there.

Durability is now the question.  I am not expecting 8-years from this battery.  If I get a few, it will be well worth it.

I bought them expecting them to be fast based on reviews. i plugged them into a usb3 port and dd'd a gigabyte off of them but was disappointed to find it barely hit 40MBps read and 18MBps write. I double checked - it was NOT connected via usb2. I was ready to return them, but used one to transfer a large file. When i read the file off, it exceeded 100MBps!

So, i've tested with half a dozen of these drives, and it appears they need to be 'conditioned' to give good read speed. If i dd zeros into the whole drive, reformat it, then use it, it seems to perform as advertised. This indicates to me that read performance will diminish over time, and that for best results, occasionally rewriting the contents of the drive will refresh the performance.

Conditioning, however, hasn't allowed me to exceed 20MBps write speed, at least on my laptop, though that could be my system's bottleneck. (haswell i3, usb3, ubuntu 14.04)","great read performance for size and price, but needs conditioning",1426550400,

Cons:

You'll need to alter your typing method to adjust to the size difference. That's not prohibitive. Just give it some time. The bigger problem is that the rubber nature of the keys require a lot more force to get the letter to type and therefore creates a lot more errors.

Works great out of the box; the only thing I had to do was ""switch"" the windows key and the alt key and turn them into the option and command keys. A few clicks in the settings pane and I was typing away.

As for the keys themselves, they definitely have more weight and travel than the keyboard that comes with the 2013 macbook pro or even the apple wired keyboard that was included in my 2012 mac pro. However, the feel of the entire keyboard is nice. It is light but not too light and heavy without being immovable.

My only grip is the space bar. Perhaps is it the placement of my hands but after long typing sessions, my thumb gets a bit sore in the area where I hit the space bar. Perhaps if I play with the location of the keyboard it may help.

Also, it is louder than the stock laptop keys. Of course this thing is not as loud as mechanical keyboards but it does have a nice click when you press any of the keys.

Lastly, I am not sure how the letters/numbers are put onto the keys but I doubt they are laser etched. Meaning that, in time the keys will indeed wear off but at under 12 dollars each, I doubt anyone will complain after years of use before replacing.

However, I am happy to report that it really gives up very little to it's siblings. As nice as the new 600EX-RT maybe, I simply could not justify the expense especially since I have no use for the built in radio transmitter functions as I am already dedicated to other radio triggers. Canon really needs to re-think this situation and offer a more competitive large flash. I digress... so I gambled on the 430EXII mostly because I really wanted to stay with the trusted brand of the Canon products. It has performed flawlessly and frankly really enjoy the slightly smaller size in handling. All of my work is off camera flash and this blends in perfectly with my other flashes. The one pleasant surprise I have had is what a miser this thing is on batteries. I usually find that I get at least 50% more shots with this side by side with either of the 580's.

After posting my scathing review, Ravelli contacted me and had GREAT customer service. They explained how this product is really meant for transport, not dolly movements. I guess I was using it wrong lol either way, they completely refunded me from a 3yr old order, including shipping fee, and let me keep the product! They were extremely nice and helpful, and the dolly works nicely for transport work. It also comes with a carrying case.. I think I'll hang onto it and give Ravelli a 2nd shot. They've earned it.

OLD REVIEW:
I don't know how this thing gets so many good reviews. I bought it years ago and I've never been able to use it. The steering is all over the place and it's super jerky, clunky and kind of heavy. God help you if you want to use this on anything but smooth glass.. get carpet, grass, tiles, or hardwood floors out of your head..Just pony up the dough and get a stabilizer or just use a tripod with video head.","Good For Transporting Tripods, Not For Stabilizing or Dolly Filming",1479168000,

It turns out the reduced OS functionality is a general Windows 4k alignment problem with Advanced Format and not specific to the Apricorn Upgrade Kit. I have hence improved my rating back up to 4 stars.

Why 4 stars? The cons I gave for my original review remain (inadequate instructions, limited control of partition sizes). Although the EZ Gig IV software includes a ""4k alignment"" option, my AF Drive still showed no 4k alignment when I ran the fsutil tool in a command prompt. I had to update my computer's AHCI controller with the latest Intel RST and install Windows 7 SP1 and Update KB982018 to solve the problem.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

------- Update July 5 2013 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My cloned hard drive works, except that Windows Update no longer works. I am not sure whether this (reduced functionality of cloned OS) is to be expected for cloning in general or is something I could have avoided if I had used Window's built-in features instead of the cloning software that came with this upgrade kit.

I have therefore decided to go for a clean install.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I bought a new hard drive and used this upgrade kit to clone my original hard drive with Windows 7 OS on the new drive. Although my computer is an older one that has only USB 2.0 ports, I bought this USB 3.0 model for future use on newer computers.
Cloning went smoothly without a hitch. Cloned a 250 GB hard drive in under 3 hours. Pros and cons are:

Pros:
1. It works! Created the clone of my 250 GB hard drive in less than 3 hrs.
2. Accompanying software is very easy to use.
3. Backward compatible with USB 2.0. Hence, It will perform even faster when I use it on a newer computer with USB 3.0....in the meantime, it works on my current USB 2.0-only computer.

Cons (why it's getting only 4 stars):
1. My original drive had 2 partitions. One of them, my OS recovery partition, was a 10 GB partition with 7.5 GB of data. Although the software allowed me to adjust the size of this partition on my clone, it gave me the choice size this partition as 7.5 GB or 20+ GB, but not a size between 7.5 and 20 GB! I wonder why!
2. There are no help files in the accompanying software that explains the need for 4 kB alignment or SmartCopy 1:1. At least you can enable or disable them, but you better know what you are doing.

In short, the upgrade kit works great and is easy to use, but limits your options if you want to make adjustments yourself; manual adjustments might be difficult if you are not computer savvy.","Easy to use and fast, but Windows Update might not work",1372291200,

This is a bit different from being a ""pro"" because I don't usually want to pay for the ""bullet proof"" feature in a light stand. I don't have some minimum wage apprentice helping me abuse the gear. I just need it to have reasonable durability and it needs to work well for the dozen or so times a year I use it. Of course, ""works well"" means that it won't drop my Canon 600s, tip over easily, etc. These fit the bill. I have two slightly shorter stands I use to hold my fill and separation sources and use this one for my high key. My ""high"" is about 8' on a normal day, so this stand can fill the bill and have a bit of reserve left over for adjustment to tall people.

All the parts work smoothly and, unlike my Ravelli backdrop stands, I didn't have to ""pin"" the end caps in place to hold them. At the price, the included case of modest quality is just fine. BTW, the case is able to contain my Impact umbrella and flash adapter once it is removed from the stand.

If I was going pro (for most of us, that would mean adding ourselves to the bazillion wedding hacks out there), I believe this stand would hold up OK until  you either make it or give up. You would want to make sure you bring sandbags (i.e. the sand filled saddlebags) to guard against tipping. When you are a pro, people are just not as nice to you or your equipment - I don't know why. These stands are pretty sturdy, but they are not super heavy. I could go on about sandbags, too, but for now just remember to line the sandbag with a gallon ziplock heavy duty bag before filling. Trust me, you'll be happier with the bag, this stand and life in general. :-)

Now after i got both, the Lowepro 200 doesn't fit much at all, its so much smaller than it looks in the commercial and the YouTube videos. for the price i paid, i regret buying it.

i have a Nikon d7000 with 18-200mm Lens and 35mm, and a lot of accessories,

what fits inside this back is the 18-200 body + 18-200mm lens + 35mm lens + external flash unit,

for the stuff i have, i am sure i am not going to use the camera, as I'll always feel the need to the other gadgets so I'll take the bower as its almost same size from outside, but plenty of space inside,

I had recently had my device stolen when I laid it down to perform a chore, so I decided that I needed a bag with a shoulder strap so that I could work hands free on light tasks, but keep my Kindle at my side at all times.  I saw several cheaper bags, but this one seemed very sturdy with only a slightly higher price.
When it arrived, I could tell that it was just as sturdy as it looked on the website.  It has four compartments in all. Three are secured by zippers, while the fourth is open, but the open compartment is deep enough that there is little chance of the contents falling out.  I quickly decided that this open compartment was ideal for my cell phone as it offered quick access to the device,(My cell phone has a habit of ringing only two rings before throwing the call to voicemail.)  This pocket is also large enough to hold the largest smartphone with ease.
All of the compartments except one are large enough to hold my Kindle fire easily. The small pocket is large enough to hold a cell phone, but it is closed by a zipper, which would slow my access to the phone, so will use it for some other purpose. It might be a useful place to keep my charger cord.
The main compartment has a divider to make it actually two compartments under a single zipper.  I keep my Kindle Fire in one compartment and my Kindle Touch in the other. (I use my Kindle Fire indoors or on cloudy days, and my Kindle Touch outdoors on sunny days.)
The last compartment is quite large,  and has two small pockets built in at the top.  For some reason, the makers made this with a zipper to secure the compartment, then covered the zipper with a flap secured with Velcro.  The Velcro is quite redundant, since the flap is sewn down in such a way that it naturally stays down quite firmly without any need for a fastener.  I quickly removed the Velcro patches and the pouch works quite well without them.  The compartment is quite roomy, and if I could save up enough for  a ten inch tablet, I could easily move my Kindle Touch into it.
I have to say that this is one of the best built bags I have ever seen.  It is light enough to be easily carried, sturdy enough to go anywhere,  and well enough padded to give excellent protection to your expensive devices.  In addition, there are enough compartments to carry a lot of other things.  It's like a small office you can hang over your shoulder.","Room for every thing, neatly organised",1420761600,

When I first received them I was pretty excited.
So I hooked them up to my MP3 player and started to check them out.
If you get them in your ear just right they sound great, a little much on the bass though.
On electronic based music (rap, techno, R&B, etc.) the bass is great, on instrument based music (rock, classical, etc) the bass is a little much.
If you have a good player, you can adjust the bass but not all players allow that.
My biggest gripe with these headphones is the cord splits and gives like 8 inches to go to your left ear and then like 16 inches to go to your right ear.
I don't like the offset design but I understand that some do.
Even so, what's with this huge difference in length?
Unless your head is like 2 feet wide, the cable going over to your right ear will be dangling all limp and goofy looking.
Also, the length to the end where the mini plug is is really too short for anyone my height.
I'm 6'2"" and I can't keep my MP3 player in my pocket because THE CORD IS TOO SHORT.
So I have to place it in my waist band while I'm working out, which I guess works but is not ideal.

As far as quality is concerned, the cable I've kept works as expected and seems to be well constructed. The shorter cable was returned to Amazon at their expense and I received an instant refund.

I'm about 6'2"" with hands to match, so I thought a bigger pen might be a good idea.  Now that I've used this and the stock s pen for a bit, I have to say, it's just not that big a deal.  I like using both pens.  If anything I like this pen most for when I'm just holding it, twirling it around while reading on the note, etc, and not necessarily writing with it.  Overall, it's really just not that big a deal or a difference from the s pen.  I'm not sure I would make the purchase again, but I don't regret having made it already.
I thought the eraser would be great, but because of the size of the pen, you kind of can't see exactly where it is, and oyu have to have it firmly pressed down to register, so for anything precise you're best off pressing the icon and turning your tip into an eraser when needed.
Also, it's slightly off.  I'm used to it now, so it's not an issue.  However, when I first got it, every mark I made was just not quite where I expected it from having used the stock pen.  Again, after a bit of use you'll simply adjust naturally and won't even notice.

Edit:
I'm leaving it at 4 stars, I would give it another half star if I could.  I still don't really use the eraser as much as I originally expected.  Using it just isn't that much more convenient than activating the eraser function itself.
However, I will say that I use the pen all the time due to the size of it.  Whenever I have writing or note taking to do, I immediately reach for this pen, rather than the spen.",Pretty Good.,1361577600,

I shoot a lot; kids, parties, performance art with available light, sport etc. plus I am getting into home studio portrait and strobism with a pair of speedlights and this camera works beautifully and reliably.
In a year I reached above 30 000 frames, nearly no video (I do stills).

Side equipment I would recommend - I don't have tons of lenses and gear so I can't speak about everything there is out there but here is what I gathered around that camera that I really use all the time. I am very happy with what I can do with this stuff.

LENSES
All three lenses are quite pricey and well-built and give gorgeous pictures that the 7D sensor captures with minute details.
- I already had a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/70-200mm-f-4-L-IS-USM/dp/B000I1X3W8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">70-200mm f/4 L IS USM</a>&nbsp;from a few years back. This lens remains one of my very favorite.
- I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-105mm-f-4-L-IS-USM/dp/B000B84KAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24-105mm f/4 L IS USM</a>&nbsp;with this 7D, also a full frame-capable lens with in mind a future upgrade to a full-frame body like the 5D-III.
- I recently procured the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canon-EF-S-10-22mm-f-3-5-4-5-USM/dp/B0002Y5WXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM</a>, which is a crop-sensor only lens - it will not work on the 1D, 5D or 6D but I really wanted a wide-angle lens and this one is just beautiful.
With these three I can do almost all I want.
If I had known I would have bought the 7D body only and foregone the 18-135mm hich is ok but really not as enjoyable as the ones listed above.

LIGHT
Add to that a Canon TTL flash or two such as
- the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/430EX-II/dp/B001CCAISE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">430EX II</a>,
- the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/580EX-II/dp/B000NP3DJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">580EX II</a>,
- or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/600EX-RT/dp/B007FH1KX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">600EX-RT</a>&nbsp;(for a comparison based on spec sheet with the 580, see my review of the 580Ex-II)
and you are all set.
You will likely find that you want some more lighting equipment but this is beyond the scope of this review.

SOFTWARE
It comes with a software bundle that covers all the bases but following the advice of a pro photographer friend of mine I still added&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lightroom-v-4-0/dp/B007Y6L2ZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lightroom v. 4.0</a>, and I am very glad I did. I wish I had known of it earlier.

The 7D is a great camera, very simple to use, yet provides a wealth of possibilities for technically inclined amateur like me.
- Once I got used to its basic controls, I found that the camera does not get in the way of taking the picture. This to me is probably the most important, even before image quality.
- The sensor gives beautiful, vibrant images - the color rendering is very close to what I see with my eyes, which is my criterion.
- The sensor also features a native ISO range of up to 6400 and at ISO 3200 the pictures are really good.
- Flash control is excellent - I frequently use the remote flash control from the camera with a 580Ex-II and a 430Ex-II together and the possibilities are staggering.
- The JPEG you get directly from the camera are gorgeous. I rarely shoot raw due to the size of the resulting files except when doing landscape or portrait, and the dedicated button that switches to raw+JPEG for the next picture is very useful to me.

There are many more good things to say about this camera but I would find myself re-writing the manual, which is informative, well written and well-worth reading from cover to cover.

Pros
- 32gb size is the largest that can be natively formatted as fat32 in windows, which is what these XDJs require
- all metal case dissipates heat
- no cap to lose
- the eyelet is offset which makes it easy to tell which way is up so none of that try one direction, rotate and try other direction, rotate and try the direction it was when you first tried but now it works.
- usb 3 speeds which may transfers from pc go fast (the XDJs just use USB 2 so it doesnt care)

Cons
- the eyelet at the top isn pretty flat and would be hard to get on a keychain on its own.  I solved this by getting a small (approx 1/2) split ring I put on this and then attached to keyring with a small sbiner that locks closed
- short (can be a plus or minus) which in my case makes it keep track of and Im always worried Ill lose it.  Its not as short as others where it only sticks out 1/8 but it still only sticks out 1/2 maybe at most.

Unit: Controls are just fine.  I don't know what everyone is complaining about.  The kickstand is right next to the dvd player and holds the unit just fine.  The screen does go funny when you look at it from below.  But left, right and above, it's fully visible at all angles.  Front controls: menu, play/pause, directional arrows with ok in center, fwd and rev.  These all do different things depending on the mode your in.  They let you navigate the screen when in ipod and SD mode, and they are the DVD controls in disk mode.  The right side is the iPod dock, the top has source, monitor, and power buttons as well as the DVD release.  The DVD door opens in back, the spindle holds the disc firm.  Left side: dual earphone jacks, AV in, AV out, volume wheel and SD card slot; plus power.

iPod: Okay, the dock allows you to slide your ipod inside the unit and control everything (except photos) from the main screen: movies, playlists, podcasts, etc.  It defaults to widescreen so you have to hit the monitor button to see them right.  But it seems to function completely in all modes.  It comes with cradle adaptors for different ipods and the remote fits in the iPod Touch cradle as though it were made for it.

DVD: plays nice, use either the front controls or the remote.  Seems fully functional.  Played my home burned DVD nicely.  Add the AV cable and it outputs to a larger screen perfectly.

SD: I recorded a movie clip with my still camera and tried to play it.  No sound.  Oh well, I didn't really need sound anyway for my purposes, but clearly there are some file compatibility issues that will frustrate some folks.

Also, this is my first DSLR and I didn't want to break the bank.  This Op/tech became the perfect solution.

Besides comfort, what made me decide on this strap was the quick release system.  While on vacation, I want to be in pictures with my wife and family, not just behind the camera, so I purchased a Gorillapod with a ball head mount.  This enables me to mount the camera to a tree, a railing, light pole, or whatever else so that I can jump in the picture too.  Although the gorillapod is rock solid, if I make a mistake in mounting it the camera can fall and break, or even not be retrievable at all if it is on a cruise ship balcony or ledge!  This is where the quick release on this strap comes in for me- every time I mount my camera to an object where the camera is in a dangerous position, the quick release allows me to strap it in for an extra layer of protection. Now the gorillapod can give way, but my investment has been protected.","Very comfortable, provides ""safety net"" for my gorillapod",1293494400,

Otherwise, with a lower height resolution under like 1024 or even 1080, you get a tall image with BIGGER fonts. However, if you want to use all that extra display real estate to display more application windows and see more text at one time, go with at least 1920 x 1200 resolution.

The 1920 width (pixels) is IMO the lowest you should look for in a 24"" or larger monitor.

Now, if your reading vision is not so good and you need much larger fonts and don't mind having less content on the screen at one time, then you'll probably need to set the resolution lower.

But for home user, you're probably in the same boat as me. Maybe one/two/three uses and you'll be done with it for a long time. For that, it works perfectly.

4 stars only because it is plastic and it doesn't seem like the connection between it and the HDD was that ""tight"".

As other reviewers have commented, it is not tiny... it is 5 X 3 X 1.5 inches, but it appears to be very well made and durable. The plug end - rather than collapsing to take less room - turns so that you can maneuver it in three different directions to make room for other devices to use the remaining wall socket.

1195134,1,15,True,"11 17, 2010",A3CL85FNXAE0RO,B001FOREK4,,Amazon Customer,"First, let me say I was more than ready to jump ship when Sony acquired Minolta and then had the nerve to advertise the a100 as the next generation of the Minolta 7D. Having owned three 7Ds the a100 was just a slap in the face. But, jumping ship is expensive and time consuming so I decided I'd wait until I couldn't use my 7D bodies anymore before starting the painful process of moving to Nikon or Canon. Besides, what I REALLY wanted was a 35mm format and everyone's 35mm bodies were horridly expensive. Waiting sounded like a good plan.

So, after a few years of watching Sony release amateur grade (barely above point-and-shoot) bodies made for midgets when they finally announced releasing the a850 and a900 I wasn't very enthused. Yes, they were 35mm but it doesn't do me any good if the body is so small I can't hold onto it. Eventually I decided to bite the bullet and see what they'd come up with.

WOW! I'd like to say Sony should have come out with this instead of the a100 several years ago and bag on them for taking so long but honestly it was worth the wait! Yes, it may be missing a feature or two that the Nikons and Canons have but the a900 is a fraction of the cost. What Sony has really done to both impress and surprise me is release a camera that is JUST A CAMERA. I'm sorry but all the wiz-bang crud (video, gps, in-camera post processing, etc) Nikon and Cannon (and others) are trying to pack into their bodies is ridiculous. The a900 is clean, easy to use and clean and simple, uncluttered and easy to use AND it's a full sized SLR body. A man with gloves could actually hold onto this camera and even operate it. Hear that Sony? The majority of SLR users are NOT ultra-petite women and children!

If you're a high end amateur or low-mid professional photographer moving from SLR film to DSLR and want to continue in a 35mm format you will not be disappointed. The menu is easy to use and clean. The quick menu lets you access all the commonly used functions quickly and easily with just a few button clicks. Actual buttons duplicate most functions (WB, Drive, ISO, shutter speed, aperture, etc) for even faster access. Continuous shooting speed is as advertised. Auto focus is fast (depending on the lens in use, of course) and accurate and about a light year ahead of the 7D. The view finder is AWESOME! It's crystal clear, large and BRIGHT. There is absolutely NO way to describe it. You have to see it yourself. Battery life is at least as good as the 7D. Still, I have two batteries for my a900 body and that's what I'd recommend having.

Things to be aware of but are not necessarily negatives: there is no built in flash. This is considered a professional body and professional grade bodies typically don't come with built in flash. It does have the Minolta hot-shoe, however, and whatever you plug in has to be compatible. RAW files are 36MB. EACH. That means you can fit about 110 on a 4GB card and they have to be FAST cards if you want to maintain the continuous shooting speed Sony claims. So, multiple cards or fewer bigger cards. I opt for the 4GB cards because if one dies I'm not loosing 200+ pictures. The RAW (or ARW as Sony names them) files require the packaged picture converter software or something like Photoshop 4+ with Camera Raw. CS3- users will have to upgrade (as I found out). Sony's software is functional but it's very clunky; CS5 Standard puts it to shame. You will need LOTS of storage on your laptop/pc. RAW->TIFF will generate HUGE files. The body is big and it is weighty. With a prime lens like the 50mm it's perfectly balanced and very easy to hold and use. Coupled with something like the Minolta 28-70mm f2.8 G or the equivalent CZ lens you have a monster. Thanks to the body size and ergonomics its perfectly manageable it's a HEAVY, BULKY package. Personally, I have no issues with this as it's the same as using my old 35mm film bodies but if you're a very petite woman or you're teaching your kids they're probably going to have problems.

One negative with the a900 -- and it ABSOLUTELY IS NOT a fault of the camera or Sony -- has turned into a nasty got-cha for me and is documented elsewhere on the 'net. If you have a lens (or more) of 'questionable quality' such as my old kit lens from one of my 7Ds they're probably going to be unusable on the a850 and a900. A 22 Megapixel 35mm body will show up and magnify any glass quality issues. A LOT! My most important piece of advice with either the a850 or a900 is to be prepared to replace your glass if necessary with GOOD glass. A poor lens on this body is just a waste of an incredible piece of technology. BTW, it is possible to use (most) APS-C lenses but again this is just a total waste of a body. Go get an a700 if you want to use your APS-C lenses.

My favorite feature (besides the view finder): AF Micro Adjust. This gives you the ability (if necessary) to 'tweak' the AF of specific lenses (up to 30 on the a900) on a per lens basis to compensate for front or back focus. This might not sound like such a hot feature but it sometimes comes in handy if you have old lenses. For example, my Minolta 50mm F2.8 Macro was always reasonably sharp but I could tell it was off just a tad if I looked closely. After making an in-camera adjustment of -3 now you can cut yourself on the pictures.

The only negative 'feature' on the a850-900 is the addition of stupid point-and-shoot features to a professional grade DSLR: Creative Style. Really?? Does anyone that buys a $2800+ body want their camera screwing with the picture? I thought that was what post-processing was for. This is a pet peeve of mine because any pictures I shoot with my Minolta lenses on any other setting than Neutral end up looking like cartoons. Minolta lenses are known for their contrast and color reproduction - IMHO, they don't need help from the camera. So, in order to compensate I'd have to make micro-adjustments to the styles and I've given up with that. I've 'fixed' Neutral and just leave it at that. IMHO, this was a waste of Sony programming resources. I think I'm going to nominate this for the 'stupid feature of the year award'.

In my opinion - which has changed since purchase - the only real drawback to the a850 and a900 is the price. Steep for even high end amateurs but after spending a few weeks with my new a900 body I've changed my opinion. The cost is well worth it if you have a lot of a-mount gear and good glass. I certainly wouldn't hesitate to do it again. In fact, I wish I would have bought one a year ago.

What makes this a great body is in most ways subjective but I believe it boils down to image quality and ease of use. The image quality is incredible and in many ways is like the difference you see between 35mm and medium format if you were comparing an APS-C DSLR (like the a700) to the a900. My personal opinion echoed by many others is that the a850-900 is one of the easiest to use and most comfortable bodies produced in quite some time. So, between these two I give the a900 an A+++.:)",Pro grade body and it shows!,1289952000,

We just returned from a Bahamas cruise, and we really enjoyed having the PlaySport with us. It's small, easy to carry, and simple to use. I haven't yet viewed any videos on a computer or TV, but they look great on the (tiny) screen. Shot at 720p, they look extremely smooth. I tended to shoot short (less than a minute) clips, and after a week have filled just over half of an 8GB card. If you shoot 1080p, obviously the card will fill more quickly but we'd read that this camera doesn't do well with moving subjects at 1080p so we just kept it on 720p. I can't comment any more on that because we simply didn't try it -- there are many reviews you can read for more on that. Battery life is fine -- you'll definitely be charging it every day if you shoot more than me, but it was fine for us. I had a spare battery with me but never switched it out. We just plugged the camera in every night. The charger is one of those little 'cube' things that plugs into the wall and has a USB jack that the camera cable then plugs into, just like an iPhone, so it's very small and easy to pack.

Drawbacks: Good thing it's so easy to use because in bright sunlight you can barely see what's on the screen. There's a mode that's supposed to increase the contrast but as far as I can tell it makes practically no difference. Battery life was fine for me but if you shoot longer videos you'll want to have a second battery ready to go. Unfortunately, you can only charge batteries in the camera itself so you can't keep one battery charging while the other's in the camera unless you buy a separate charger. This is a tradeoff for not having to pack a separate charger so for me that was fine. The microphone isn't shielded against wind so many of the clips I shot are quite noisy soundwise. For me, the access doors for the battery and cables, etc. seemed like they could lock more securely. They don't exactly feel flimsy, but the way they lock doesn't really give confidence that they'll keep the water out. Of course, they worked just fine so maybe it's not a problem.

Bottom line is, if you keep in mind the real purpose of this camera as a casual shooter that doesn't mind getting splashed at the beach, for $149 it's a great gadget to have. We're glad we bought it.",Great for the beach,1275868800,

With that said...there are a few things that I do NOT like about this product.

WARNING BUYERS!!! If you own a 60D, T3i or any slr with an articulating screen then this might not be the product you're looking for.  That is because once you install the metal frame around the lcd...you can NOT close the screen(face down.)
You will have to leave the screen face up once it's installed, so If you do decide to get this then be prepared to have some lcd screen protectors installed.

As far as the quality of the lcdvf...it's not bad.  Pretty sturdy, magnet holds well, nice big eye cup.  BUT the actual image quality is poor.  Putting this cheap lens over a million-pixel lcd screen does not do any justice.  It makes the picture look very dull and I can't see the thing helping me focus any better.  (I have 20/20 vision)

So...like I said, the product is good if you need to keep glare out of the screen when shooting outdoors.  But I will probably avoid using this indoors since it would serve no purpose at all.

***EDIT***

After a couple months I have a new opinion on this product with the Canon 60D.  To solve the swivel LCD problem I simply bought some sticky rubber grip that you would stick on the bottom of a vase so it doesn't slide around on the end table.  I cut it to fit all four sides of the lcdvf so that it would fit snug around the screen and not slide.  Then I purchased some large elastic headbands that women keep the hair back with and simply looped them around and attached them to the slr.  It was an easy fix for less then $10.",decent for the money,1301616000,

7 standard is designed a bit differently to reduce interference and allow better communication and stability at the maximum distance.

What does 7 standard offer the guy in a 1 bedroom apartment with the desk beside the router? Not much actually, though if you have lots of electronic devices nearby, the interference changes may be useful on paper.

A nice upgrade to the IEEE standard that users in a ""noisy"" environment, as well as users looking to build an infrastructure will definitely benefit with. For the rest of us, there's nothing wrong with it, but it's not noticeable at all in day-to-day, router to pc use.

The Samsung Chromebook in itself is a nifty little product - it's small, lightweight, fast for its size, and it has incredible battery life. Of course, the reason this is true is because it doesn't have an internal hard drive, which is what sucks the power out of every other laptop out there and adds at least a few pounds to the weight. But for what it's worth, $250 is not a bad price for this little machine. If someone is going to buy this product for internet surfing, listening to music, maybe doing a little bit of word formatting or etc., then this does the job. 5 stars.

However, on the flip side, this machine as a PC really can't do a lot. You can't download programs onto this laptop and do what you would typically do on other computers. I haven't taken a look at any Google Apps that you can download, but chances are, they aren't as powerful as regular programs running on a Mac or a PC. It's basically just a fancy internet browser, which happens to sync your settings via your Google account. So, if you're looking for a small laptop which has the same capabilities as a regular PC, this isn't it. 2 stars.

As for me, I purchased this product with every intention of modifying it and changing it to my own needs. Since this computer has two USB slots (2.0 and 3.0) as well as an SD card reader, I am booting an entirely different operating system (Xubuntu 13.04) off of the SD card. Since I am using a completely different operating system than Chrome OS, I am able to run programs on this computer normally like any other laptop or PC, and I basically have modified everything to suit my own needs.

When I installed the new unit in place of the old one, my powered monitors went full distortion due to the insane input levels. As it turns out, the volume control does not actually control the signal output. It is only there for the headphone output. The owner's manual clearly indicates that the volume control should control the output to powered speakers on an amp, but apparently that is not true. In one swell foop they made a wonderfull piece of electronics useless to speaker listeners. I cannot fathom that decision, but that is life. I have no use for the X1S.

I am very angry over this. Here is why:
- I am angry because I fell for this. I have been building audio systems for almost half a century. I learned long ago not to put a high signal level straight into an amplifier and hit it with a source. I almost fried a set of studio monitors, and I felt like an idiot.
- I am angry because I feel betrayed by a manufacturer that I trusted. How can they upgrade an excellent product and remove a large percentage of the functionality? I won't be trying any more Aune components. I can't trust them to make sensible decisions.
- I am angry because the seller (Ingenious Ingenuity) was so very clueless and useless. I finally got a refund, but it took several emails, a phone call, and a plea to Amazon.

It is a little heavy to carry around, but it has worked great for me using it in rental cars with a cassette adapter, and in various hotel and cruise cabins with the portabale speaker system. I have found the controls and menus to be easy to work thru, and easy to see. I am not sophisticated by any means, and still learning, but this unit is easy to use, and maintenance is a non-issue. Battery life isn't as the company predicted, but I got at least 6.5 hours of driving time out of it, and that was enough.

Storage of music is tremendous, and quite possibly more than I would ever be able to use, but as a portable storage device for transferring pics over a long vacation, it fills the need in me.

The problems with the unit are that it does freeze up at times, but very, very rarely during playback. Mostly it hangs up when I am downloading to the unit, or is not recognized by the PC, which has happened frequently. Once I retry, after a day or so, it loads up as though nothing had ever happened. This is disruptive, especially when you are under the gun and trying to load up before a trip, and has occured at those times, 3 times in a row. Still wouldn't give up the unit though. The biggest problem I have is not really with the unit per se, but with how the music is loaded and displayed in the folders. I guess it is related to the Tagging of the music, and needs to be cleaned up (which is really labor intensive, so free music really isn't free).

Tried to purchase accessories from Creative but, they fell down on the job because of relocation of their warehouse, or so they said. Other than that, they were pretty good at explaining any issues with the unit within the first 30 days.

This unit fits that bill perfectly.  There is no way I would want to spend more money to get the small differences I might have gotten from a more expensive unit.  Not for what I need.

I'm not sure what some reviewers are after, but I can't imagine this not being enough bass for most people.  I have the bass settings at less than half of what the unit is capable, and it is plenty.  It really makes a big difference.

Install was reasonably easy, but I had to remove the bolts to the front passenger seat to get it under the seat.  It just wouldn't slide past the brackets without removing the front seat bolts, but it fits under there very well.

I also ran a new power wire from the battery to power it directly.  A little work, but nothing too drastic.

Unit works great but there are a few gottya's that you must work around.  First the TV Guide is klunky but it works.  Secondly the Comcast cable box blocks the TV Guide from getting to the Recorder.  Thus to make it work you have to add a splitter, connecting one to the cable box RF-IN and another to the Recorder RF-IN.  Then take the Video/R/L output on the cable box and connect it to the Recorder IN1 or IN3.  OUT1 of Recorder Video/R/L then goes to TV.  This way you get the TV Guide direct from Comcast bypassing the box.  You will only be able to use the TV Guide for non-scrambled shows, which in my case is everything but HBO and On-Demand.  I still have a TV Guide listing for HBO but I must use IN1 selection to manually record On Demand and HBO.  Since most of the things I am recording are basic cable stations I don't have a problem.  Also it allows me to use IN1 to use the Comcast TV schedule for general viewing.  TV Guide really is poor but it works and it isn't Panasonic's fault Comcast doesn't pass the TV Guide signal through its box (Motorola Digital).

Other than that headache if you are not a technical person you will probably have problems hooking it up.  My parents could never operate it.  My kids have no problems.","DMR-EH50S works with Comcast TV Guide as well, sort of...",1138665600,

Turns out, My 2nd unit will give me exactly the same problem everyone else was describing: constant disconnection.

I usually leave my HDDs docked and mounted 24/7. There are programs running on the background all the time, and I personally find it more convenient to simply have them connected, turned on, and mounted all the time, instead of removing them. This dock cannot handle that. It disconnects, regardless of its condition. At first, I suspected there might an issue with my Mac, since the first unit in my office didn't have any problem. So I did a little research, dug up the reviews that I once read, from the website where I first made my purchase. Needless to say, everyone else was having exact same issue.

While I will not recommend this product, it does make me wonder what the hell is going on. Is this QA issue, or was I simply lucky with my first unit? I doubt I'll get an answer to that question.

I was contacted by Mediasonic, as you can see in the comment section. Although I haven't heard back from them since, Mediasonic's own forum does have a post indicating one their feature has become more or less a trouble for many customers and will kill the feature with new update, which was released on 2013. I'm not sure if this is the one problem that Mediasonic mentioned, but I'll just sit tight and wait for now.

As far as tape decks go, it seems to be pretty good overall. The instructions are a bit misleading, though. It has instructions for two different models. These instructions seem to imply only the upper model (TCWE675, which is discontinued)  has Dolby B, C and support for type II and IV tapes. Well, this TCWE475 DOES have Dolby B, C and auto-tape type selection for type II and IV tapes. Don't let the instruction manual at Sony's site confuse you, this deck does have these features.

Unfortunately, it doesn't come with the remote, the remote must be ordered separately from Sony's website (for around $30).  However, the remote from my old Sony deck works with this deck. So if you have a remote from an old Sony deck, it might work with this unit. (The remote is part number RM-J910. If you had an old Sony tape deck that specifies that model remote in the manual, its remote will work with this deck.) Some different remotes from Sony receivers will work as well. At least this deck *is* remote controllable. Most of the other brands of tape decks made today appear to require a receiver of the same brand and a special cable connected between the two in order to get any kind of remote capability for the tape deck. This is one major reason why I chose the Sony. With the Sony, you just need to obtain the actual remote, you don't need the same brand receiver.

One word of caution. My old Sony deck was designed so that a thin rubber belt driven by a motor engaged and disengaged the tape heads. When that belt became flabby and weak from age (as all these belts do, even if the unit just sits around unused), the tape heads became stuck in the engaged position. This meant that the deck could not eject the tape, it held it captive. About the only ways to retrieve it would have been either to repair the deck or disassemble it to pieces. (And replacing the belts in that model would have been a pain.) So if the deck has been sitting around for a few years without use, test it out on a tape you don't care about first. (With my old Sony deck, it did not fail till it was about 10-12 years old. Although frequent use will probably cause the belts to wear sooner than that.) I don't know whether or not Sony has improved the design with this model. It's possible other brands might use a design similar to my old Sony anyway. (I believe most tape decks use belts, and all belts wear/fail.)",Works for Me,1268956800,

They did not disappoint. I've had their GigaWorks T20 computer speakers for a couple years and I love them. Rich sound from top to bottom. Granted, there's no replacement for a subwoofer. But if I want the full audio experience I sit in my living room, crank it, and hope the people who live below us don't complain.

I bought the D200 for the bedroom. It's about 12 x 18 sq. ft. The D200 fills it easily. The bass port on the back does a nice job with the low end (like I said, don't expect miracles), and the front drivers give a nice range of highs and mids. We played a variety of genres on day one. I felt like the break-in period was remarkably short which is why I'm writing this review after only 3 days. Day 2 my wife put on a classical piece with drastic dynamic changes and we were both impressed. I don't detect distortion at all. Everything comes through clearly at low, mid, or high volume.

Connection issues: I've got a Samsung Galaxy S III and it pairs nicely via Bluetooth. Transmits through any single wall. Double walls cause trouble. My wife has an iPhone 3gs and it pairs nicely as well. The aux in experience is not quite as beautiful as the Bluetooth experience. I suggest keeping the D200 turned off and plugging in any aux in devise before powering on the unit. If you fail to do this, touching the player end of the cable to anything causes harsh and potentially damaging noises to come through the speaker. This is a function of the simple connection technology / user interface, however. But there is another factor that makes me dislike the aux in feature: it plays quiet. I'd say that Bluetooth connection is about 2X as loud as the aux in connection. And for aux in a hiss is audible until the player passes an audio signal through the speakers. If there is any hiss beyond that moment I cannot tell.

Bottom line: Sound quality is amazing for the small speaker system. Aux in works; Bluetooth works better - but Bluetooth is more convenient in almost every way. And the D200 keeps a good wireless connection with devices. Also, don't forget that this unit requires a wired power connection - there is no battery option.",Good sound from a compact unit,1367971200,

I did take the time to do a lookup of the user manual for this device, and it listed the description for the USB button on the remote as 'multimedia'.  Not to put too fine a point on it, only being able to look at pictures is NOT multimedia.  This limitation should be in the product description.

so about the speakers. Straight out of the box they look great, until you pick them up, they are as light as a feather. So much for real wood as the descrition says (which is the reason i bought them). So i plugged them in, and it took maybe 2 minutes to get them set up. Immediately i noticed that these had a very cheap sound to them sort of reminded me of a tin can or something, no real rich sound. The bass was very boomy, and did not really range in tones. Then within a few minutes i noticed that the right speaker cut in an out due to faulty wiring. I am not sure is this is why they were an open box return. But even if the wiring was nto bad, i would not pay more than 15 dollars dor these speakers. Needless to say i returned them. My suggestion would be to buy some altec Lansing speakers. I have two sets right now, one is 4 years old, and the other one about 7 months. Both of them sound amazing, and really have no prpblems. You can find some lower end ones, such as the ones i have for 30 to 50 dollars. i guess you get what you pay for, but go with a brand you trust, and you should nto be disapointed. I know i will avoid this brand.

looks
ease of use and set up
cons:
sound quality

poor wiring

Though the Sony player worked just fine, setting it up was just plain clumsy and unintuitive (and I consider myself to be reasonably savvy with electronic/computer ""geeking"").  Now, as a ""geek,"" I must say here that I would not have dismissed consideration of the Sony player simply because of a painful setup/configuration routine.  I have ""geeked"" clumsier devices and generally embrace such challenges.  However, for customers like my 73 year-old (technically challenged) mother, Sony's clumsy configuration routine was (and is sure to be for other technophobic customers) a deal breaker.  The Sony unit was $10 more also.  Anyway, I decided then that, since I had experienced the Sony unit up close and personal (and was not especially impressed.....at least with the gross lack of intuitive setup/configuration requirements), I would give the Roku HD player a go.  The unit arrived quickly (love Amazon Prime!) and was an absolute breeze to install. As I installed the player with a customized PC surround sound system and a large LG flat screen computer display (that lacks onboard audio electronics), wiring the player up took a few extra minutes for me, but, once I fired up the unit, configuring it for my wireless network and learning how to use it required (quite literally!) only minutes.  Use of the remote functions for each of the online streaming providers, though pretty intuitive, does take a few minutes to learn, but otherwise everything was a breeze.  Like many other reviewers, I was a little annoyed by Roku's insistence that I provide a credit card number (as well as the fact that that was not advertised up front), but, all other things considered, I have no problem giving the unit a full suite of 5 stars!  I did have a minor issue with the remote after arrival.  A small piece of the rubber finger pads fell off the remote (manufacturing defect) after a week's usage.  The remote still functioned, but  I called Roku about the problem and they shipped a brand new remote to me (via FedEx 2-day) no questions asked.  They didn't even want the defective remote shipped back.  Great after-purchase support!  You can't go wrong with this product, or the price!",Amazing (and simple!) device!,1341705600,

This only works if you have your AM/FM radio set on the selected channel all the time. My work around was to set one of my radio's Chanel Selector Buttons to the unit's preferred channel for communication. Obviously this means a quick fumble to get to the channel selector button quickly enough to then push it and then hit the talk selector on the unit. This is all well and good, but I mostly listen to Sirrius Satellite Radio. That means I first have to switch over to AM/FM, then change the channel to the unit's selected channel and then push the talk selector button on the unit...all while trying to stay on the road and not T-Bone or Rear-end the car in front of me. OK, so now I've got the caller on the line, but the difference between the radio volume and the phone volume is so different that I then have to turn the volume up to at least 3/4 full to hear anything. Needless to say, when the call is over, I have to readjust the volume after I get back to Sirrius so I don't blow my eardrums out.  Oh, and then there is the issue of cll quality. My wife asked me the other day, ""What is all that static and noise on your phone?"" Yea, well the call quality sucks too. Well, the option is to spend $2,000 to replace the radio with one that has those features built in. Maybe for Christmas, but this sure isn't the answer.

Loved having one, but finally decided that a color display, upgradable base map and more sensitive receivers in the newer units made it silly not to upgrade.

I know a guy that works with some pretty high powered GPS technology and could have gotten me a price break on a Magellan unit, but said that the 60CSx was getting good reviews.  He was right, but my two minor complaints is that there is no serious base map loaded (need to buy the $129 CD) and the display doesn't/can't rotate the image so I can lay it on my dash while I drive; I need more gadgets to hold it steady.

The features are top notch and the computer interface (once I figured out all the settings needed to get them talking to each other) is solid.  I upgraded the memory from the 128 that comes with it to a 2 gig in anticipation of downloading the map files, based on some on line chatter.

I swapped out my 20 year old antenna, which is in the attic, with the DB4.  I used a JVC HD TV to test the signal strength since it has a menu option to view the receiving strength of Air signals.  I had no luck in getting a signal with the antenna in the attic.  I pulled the DB4 down and connected the JVC TC, which is located in my basement.  I was able to achieve a reading between 48 and 77 depending on the direction of the antenna. I re-installed the DB4 back in the attic and I still get zero no matter what direction the antenna faced.  My 20 year old antenna was able to get 60 plus signal strength in the attic, which is why I am giving this product one star.

update (11-19-2011): I upped the rating to 4-stars since I was able to find the problems with the antenna.  The minor problem was that the nuts on the mounting screws became loose.  Once I tighten down the screws and disconnected the cable feed, which was the main problem, I was able to pull in about 12 channels.","its ok, not great",1318550400,

Wrong sized tip can easily deform the soft screw head...its on pretty snug. Popped open the cover (its the one in the middle). The old memory chip is held in by two chromed rails, one on each end. Pull the ends of the rails outwards simultaneously and the memory chip pops up at a 45degree angle. Ground myself by touching something metal. Removed the old memory. Next lined up the new memory into the slot (can only go on one way with the slot on the memory board facing the front of the computer) and wiggled it down until the brass contact points disappear. Pushed down the memory and the two chrome rails snapped into place with its tiny nubs falling into the memory board cutout on the sides. If the memory is not seated all the way down, these rails do not lock down.

Put the battery back in and fired up the computer. After it has finished booting, hit control-alt-delete to bring up the task manager.

The Celestron adapter is made of plastic and wobbles when they have the binoculars attached to them making them almost useless. So after reading the reviews for the all metal Barska tripod adapter I placed my order for one and it arrived today.

It is indeed all metal (except for the screw knob to attach it to the binoculars. For the price it seems to be very well made. It attached easily to my old tripod and was _much_ better than what came from Celestron. The larger knob was much easier to grasp and turn to attach the adapter to the binoculars and they held the binoculars steady without any wobble. What motion you do have, however, is the tilt (yaw) of the binoculars which is not a problem as it does allow you to angle them to suit your needs. I also attached it to my new monopod and it was perfect for what I wish to use it for.

I had no installation problems with an MSI 760GM-P35 motherboard (bought in 2011) running Windows 7, 64-bit. I downloaded the latest drivers from www.inateck.com/support, though I had no problem reading the included CD. The card has a green light on it, inside the computer case, for a reason that eludes me.

With a USB 3.0 hard drive docking station connected to this card, my write speed is limited by the SATA hard drive I'm using, about 80 million bytes/sec. My read speed in the docking station is actually faster than connecting the drive to my motherboard's controller. When verifying files on the external drive using parity files, I'm getting 107 million bytes/sec. I get only 86.4 million bytes/sec on internal drives.

With this card I can write to my external drives 2.78 times faster and read 3.83 times faster than with USB 2.0. I wish I'd done this upgrade a couple of years ago when I got my docking station.

Copying to a USB 3.0 flash drive I get only 34.3 million bytes/sec due to the slowness of writing to flash memory. But it reads at 136.4 million bytes/sec.

Copying from the flash drive to the docking station, both plugged into this card, I got 79.4 million bytes/sec. This is the top speed of the hard drive, so the card may be able to go faster. The card was handling 160 million bytes/sec total. My current USB 3.0 hardware can't peg this card's speed limit.

USB 3.0 uses 9 wires (the original 4 contacts plus 5 deeper in the plug), so be aware that you can't get USB 3.0 speeds with old cables and old front panel sockets.

The reviewers of this and similar cards who say damage was done to motherboards and USB devices are probably connecting the supplementary power backwards. Pay attention to the color of the wires and the shapes of the plugs! Also be sure to actually unplug your computer, not just soft power down, before installing cards into the motherboard.",An easy and worthwhile upgrade.,1432944000,

Cons - 1.) This router does not seems to be able to give me the total speed of my cable line which is 100 Mbps.  With the Dlink DIR-645 router I was able to get wired speeds of 95-110 Mbps.  The top speed I have seen wired in through Cat 5 cable or wireless is about 87 Mbps on the GHz 5 channel.

2.) The worst thing about this router is that it does not seem to be able to hold a connection either wired or wireless.  I am constantly seeing my Yahoo Messenger window on my screen close the connection and then relog on.  This is very frustrating when I am try to download music through Shareaza because it reset all the connections to all the serves it is hooked to.  This cause it to take about 5 minutes to re-establish all its connections.  About that time it get reconnected, it drops everything all over again and starts reconnecting all over again.  This is the second AC1900 I have had and both of them did the exact same thing.

3.) After about 4 hours of being on-line my connection speeds drop from 87 Mbps to around 30 Mbps.  If I disconnect and reconnect I will get connection speeds of 87 Mbps.

4.) There is no MAC filtering on this router which was a nice feature on the DIR645 router that I am replacing.

I don't think you can do do better for the price.  I started out with a 5 meg connection, then 10, then 20, and now Time Warner is offering 100 and soon 300 meg connection speeds and this modem has worked perfectly at all those speeds.  Dual band is important, especially at faster speeds.  On the 2.5GHz band, the best I could get was about 40 m/sec download speed.  On my iPad Air, and after upgrading the network card in my laptop, I easily get 90 m/sec.  There are couple of minor issues, though: The ethernet lights on the back panel are really, really bright (a pet peeve of mine). They light up the room at night, also for some reason these lights sometimes flash (not rapidly as if sending/receiving data, but on-off-on-off) making it truly annoying, like being in a cheap Motel room with a neon sign out the window. There is no USB port, so no making this a NAS by plugging in a Hard drive.  There are some minor User-Interface issues:  It's not always obvious whether the changes you are making apply to the 2.5GHz or 5GHz band or both. The 'helpful hints' that pop up if you point at a particular setting can sometimes be very helpful with explanations of what the setting does and how changing it may change things.  But in other instances they offer no explanation or helpful advice.  The User guide is no more informative,  leaving you to either Google the name of the setting, or contact Zoom support (which is generally very responsive).  I'm nit-picking though....other modems have similar issues.  Those quibbles aside, Performance is very, very good.  Setup on Time Warner Cable was easy, just requiring a phone call to activate.

Programming is a bit complex and time consuming but straightforward and the instructions are first rate. As with most techie things theses days it's probably more complex than it needs to be, but of course that's because it NEEDS to be since everything it controls is so complex. The only problem and the exception I was referring to is I can't seem to program it to select my internet access on my new Samsung TV.

NEGATIVES: If you want reliability, don't fall for the cheap price tag. STAY AWAY and pay a few dollars more for a more reliable pair. You're rolling the dice with these!

So, I am writing a rare negative review to spare anybody considering buying these headphones the possible disappointment of your headphones basically failing to function after 2 months!

I really love this style of headphones from China. Yes, they are packaged under different name like ARCTIC OR KINOVIO, but they are basically the same headphones from an exterior point of view. And they are relatively cheap with decent sound for BT headphones. And they pair relatively easily. This is probably why they are so popular.

I have owned 2 other pairs of this style of BT headphones under the names ARCTIC Sound ORACO and then Kinivo BTH220. They look exactly the same from one pair to the next except for the logos. And at first they perform very well. The ARCTIC Sound ORACO lasted about 1 year, which is a long time for a these headphones (and the $28 price tag). The KINOVIO brand lasted about 7-8 months, which was respectable for the price. I use them mostly for working out and it's nice not to have a cable in the way, esp. with weights.

But this last pair of ARCTIC P253BT headphones failed after 2 months. I don't know if sweat got into the electronics and shorted something out or it just up and failed, but the left speaker went first and then a few days later the dang thing just failed to work even though it was still pairing to my iPhone just fine.

Whether this was just a lemon pair or the overall quality of these headphones pales in comparison to the others, I am not sure. Most people seem happy with them. But I expect this product to last longer than a few months.",FAILED After 2 months - Do not use for workouts!,1378339200,

It might be good for a small child or for an adult that wears their music player on their upper arm (close to their ears). On the Amazon website for this product, it indicates a cord length of .8m. Unfortunately, that did not register with me when I ordered the item. After receiving the product and doing the calculation from meters to inches, 0.8 meters is 31.5 inches, which is pretty short, but longer than the actual 28 inches on the headset I received. Most headset cords seem to be 45 inches long.  The ear buds stay in your ears well and the sound is decent, so that is good, but the earpiece is quite large - especially when trying to fit them under a bathing cap - these are waterproof and that implies can be used comfortably for swimming.  I recommend that the seller change the advertised cord length to 28 inches (instead of .8m) and place that info in a more prominent spot so people thinking about buying the item cannot miss the fact that it has a very short cord.",Very Short Cord,1428451200,

My requirement was a wireless/Bluetooth speaker for kitchen and for a reasonable price. I looked at everything from $20-$150. The Creative ZiiSound D3x was the one I was about to buy and I stumbled across this cheap little speaker. This was only $20 with shipping so I thought I'd give it a try and save $100. When I received the speaker in mail I was about to leave somewhere so I hooked it up with my iPhone using the aux cable (provided) and listened to streaming music in the car. I was very disappointed as the sound was not very crisp and the road noise made it even worse. When I tried it using the Bluetooth and the sound quality was way better and looked promising. Now that I've tried it for several days I can say that this speaker definitely works better indoors (may not be the best for outdoors/car). It produces a decent sound in a small room, kitchen counter area etc. Bluetooth is easy to connect, but the range is very less. May be 10ft max and then it starts to drop off. Also, any obstructions, yes even a person standing in the way, can cause drops in playback. Pairing multiple phones is easy, but sometimes a hassle as you have to power off and pair it again to work properly. It comes with a USB cable and I used the iPhone/iPad charger to charge it. Bass is less, but the mids are fine and lots of treble. But again I only paid $20, so can't expect premium sound from this. Battery seems to last at least 3-4 hours or so, haven't fully tested it. There is a little plastic piece it comes with, which acts as the stand (you insert it in the slot behind and it holds the speaker in a tilt fashion). The size also was smaller than it looked in photos. I'll try and upload a couple of photos for comparison.

Don't get me wrong, it's a decent product for the money, but if I could redo it all over again I will spend a bit more money and get something else for $30-50 bucks. There are plenty of options on Amazon.com for that price range.

-- June 2013 --
Update: Two months later the speaker is still going strong and the battery lasts forever! I still stick with my earlier verdict, I would buy something better for 30-50 bucks, but for $20 there is probably nothing that beats this little speaker!

-- Feb 2015 --
Update: I still have this and it still works great. The sound quality is actually very nice for the price. The battery lasted a year or so and I bought a replacement battery from eBay for like $2-3.

I had it for about a year, I believe before it started cutting in and out on sound. That meant one of two things: replace the transmitter or replace the aux port. I liked it OK but my port is sunk in pretty low in my dash console making it harder to get to and it had to be charged regularly.

I took a chance and bought this car kit because I liked the idea of it never needing to charge and that it came with the 3 port charger. I need at least 2, sometimes 3 and it's nice not to have to unplug one to be able to charge something else. This one attaches to the dash with a magnet so you can put it in any convenient place that is withing good reach. I believe it powers up as soon as your turn the key over. It also connects immediately if my BT is engaged on my phone already. It lets me send voice search/text without cutting out my music. I have not tried to make a call while music is playing, but I imagine both can be done simultaneously if voice text and music can be done.

The ONLY reason this is getting 4 stars and not 5 is because I have only had it for a few weeks so I cannot attest to how long it will last.

For people who are looking for a review of the actual PC (not just the OS), you should be pleased to know that this computer is GREAT!

I originally purchased this computer on black friday for $379, and with all the features the computer comes with, especially the HDD and RAM space, it was a steal.

After many weeks of using this computer, I am more than pleased with its performance. I gave it 5 stars simply because this computer will not disappoint. Here are the aspects that I really like about this computer.

== PROS ==

(1) REALLY FAST START UP: After the first time turning it on, it quickly went through the start up process in which it booted windows and took my info. Very easy process. There are many unnecessary programs that come pre installed with any new PC, so after uninstalling all of the trial apps that came pre loaded with the unit, the computer literally starts up in seconds!

(2) ITS QUIET: You can barely hear the computer when its on, there is no noise from the fan that I can hear. You may even forget its on - thats how quiet it is. Its great if you need to turn on the computer without waking anyone.

(3) THE SPECS: Like I said before, for the price I paid for the unit ($379), 1 TB hard drive space plus 6GB of RAM is a steal. This unit also has WIFI, so I have it connected to all of my devices on our home network, it even connects to the printer wirelessly.

(4) FAST: Did I mention its fast? With all the RAM space, running apps to surfing the web to playing music and watching videos, everything is done with top notch speed.

(5) COMPATIBILITY: Almost every program that worked on previous versions of Windows should work like a charm on Windows 8

(6) MULTIPLE PORTS: There are multiple USB 2.0 ports in the front of the PC, and two USB 3.0 ports in the back of the unit. I also have the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-Z313-Speaker-System/dp/B002HWRZ2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech Z313 Speaker System</a>&nbsp;attached to the audio port in the back which also works flawlessly

== CONS ==

There aren't many faults about this computer! The only fault I saw is the removal of the ""start button"" in the Windows 8 operating system.

(1) NO ""START"" BUTTON: This is a setback i've seen in many reviews of Windows 8, but there is a solution to this ""problem."" If you don't like the new start menu in Windows 8, you can download a free app which restores the start button that we all know and love! I have been using it since purchasing this PC, and it works like a charm! The app is called ""StartMenu8""  (iobit[dot]com/iobitstartmenu8[dot]php) which is produced by a company called ""IOBIT."" This app is really useful to anyone who wants the functionality of the old Start Button in Windows, it really works! It essentially brings back the taskbar to the way it looks in Windows 7!

== REVIEW ==

I had to write a review for this PC because I saw too many were reviewing only one aspect of the unit (the operating system), but that doesnt do this computer any justice! I love this desktop and I hope you buy it too. I bought it when it had no reviews and I'm glad I did. The price for this unit has increased since the time that I purchased it, but for what its worth, its a great PC. If you do not like the way the new Windows 8 looks with the removal of the Start Button, there are alternatives to bringing it back, as mentioned in my review! So overall, this is a great PC, if you are on the edge in deciding, JUST BUY IT, you will not regret it!",REALLY GREAT DESKTOP!!,1356652800,

If you drop the case your iPad survives with no damage. You can even drop it in 3 ft. of water and it will come out unscathed, (if you pull it out soon enough). If you want military grade protection this is the case you want.

It cradles the Apple Bluetooth Keyboard with space underneath the keyboard for the charging cable and other bits. A cutout is provided for the charging head. If you have thought of buying a Zagg or New Trent case with bluetooth keyboard forget it. The Apple keyboard is a joy to type on and fits perfectly in the Pelican Case.

My IPad with retina display fits perfectly with a Zagg total protection kit on it, (top and bottom protection). A IPad with a Apple Smart Cover will also fit in the case. A IPad with a Apple Smart Case will not fit in the case. I bought a Skinny 3 STM case for my IPad which has a hard back and folding screen cover. It works with the Pelican although the case might not be waterproof
if you drop it in your swimming pool. (Is that really a issue)? The STM case is thin, has a hard back your IPad snaps into and the screen cover folds back for two viewing angles. It provides a nice platform when you set it up in the lid of the Pelican Case. The STM case costs $39.00, exactly what a Apple Smart Cover costs.

Other reviewers have whined about the case having a shoulder strap. Big deal. Just shorten the strap to a handle size and get over it. The Pelican Case is the best option available if you want to protect your IPad.",Best Protection Out There,1341273600,

I can clearly hear dialogue and sound effects with authority during movies.  My wife has complained about not being able to hear clearly, and we used to turn on subtitles for her, but now she can hear very well.
I'm setting the crossover frequency to 100 hz even though this center channel is rated down to 45 hz.  Its power really drops off between 80 and 70 hz.  That means a separate subwoofer will handle everything below 100 hz and free this center channel to handle the higher ranges which it does with ease.  It does play down to 45 hz but it's a whisper at that point.
I'm not sure how it stacks up against a larger full size center channel, but it sounds great in my movie room.  I think, to a point, technology has seen some advances in designing smaller speakers to deliver lower frequencies.
The sound quality is fine to me, and my ears can't tell that it's not timbre matched with my Onkyo tower speakers.  I'm very pleased with the purchase.

They stay on fine too which is more than i can say for ANY other pair i've tried. If the ear piece that surrounds the ""speaker"" were a bit softer, these would score a bit higher. I wouldn't call them uncomfortable, but after an hour your ears begins to feel-it. If you are looking for earbuds for anything other than exercise, try shure e3C.",Does the job for running,1279843200,

When it works, it's an awesome little MP3 player. The problem is, more often than not it will simply stop working. They stay in your ears during the swim, although you want to make sure you have the correct sized earbuds because a single drop of water will ruin the seal and drastically reduce the volume of your music. This is expected behavior.

After about a week with these they stopped charging. I searched for similar issues online and found a bunch of threads online with tips. Reset, format, clean the leads, delete music, uninstall Media Go if you use it, etc. These are just a few of the tips from Sony support and for me, non of them worked. I contacted Sony support and tossed the useless tech in my gym bag to get them out of my sight while i waited to hear back. A month later and i had heard nothing from support. I just happened to attempt to charge them and ""Boom"", they worked. It was a good month, swimming and running with music before they refused to turn on again. I could connect them to my computer and see their contents, but they just refused to turn on. Tossed em in a bag again and forgot about them. Randomly, they started working again. Was fun for another week and they have stopped working again.

Not really sure what to do at this point. I hate to admit defeat, but it's been too long to ask for a refund, and Sony support hasn't responded. i'll submit for a warranty replacement and hope they respond to that.

Save yourself the headache and avoid these. I don't normally call tech trash, but these are. If you don't believe me, do some googling and see how many ""happy customers"" you can dig up.

I get a solid 60FPS in any game I throw at them. (got 60fps even with only one card in minecraft with 128x128 texture pack and max settings)

The one complaint I have is the power connections require 4 LP4 PSU power connections for EACH CARD! so you'll need TWO Molex peripheral PSU power cables with FOUR connectors if you want to do SLI like me. (If you're just doing one card you'll only need one molex with four LP4 connectors).

OR you can do what I did in the pictures below and buy four of these http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067SLY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 -
They work perfect and make the cables much easier to manage. Though its about the same price to order an extra Molex (maybe be cheaper depending on your PSU brand) peripheral cable from the manufacturer of your power supply, I found that this was easier (and faster with prime shipping).

If you are new to installing video cards and have any questions just ask.

Short version: UPS is fine, as long as you do not draw more than ~600 watts and don't want to use the software.  The unit provides many features, and is a good value for performance.  Switching time is great, and this unit works fine with PFC computer power supplies.  Good buy if you're looking for a solid midrange UPS for a mid-range gaming computer.  If you're running a high-end computer (overclocked CPU, dual graphics cards) you will want to read further to determine if this UPS is worth your money.

I will begin by saying I am an abnormal use case.  At the time I realized this UPS is not as capable as I thought it was, I was already outside of the return window.  This isn't an issue of degradation, but one of there not being a set standard as to how to rate UPSs.  At this point, I am sure you have some idea as to what my problem is, but first a little back story.

I have a computer I built myself.  At the time of issue I had an Intel Core I3-2105, 8GB of RAM, an overclocked EVGA sourced nVidia GTX670, and an overclocked MSI sourced nVidia GTX 560Ti with 448 Cores.  This is a fairly low-power CPU paired with two graphics cards that while not power hungry, they use a nice bit of power (think sports cars as opposed to full out race cars).  All of this is being powered by an 850 watt PSU (complete overkill as you'll see in a few).  With the components I have, I rarely draw more than 500 watts from the wall.  For me to do this, I have to fully load both (overclocked!) graphics cards as well as the CPU with artificial stress tests.  In other words, in real world usage, I'm never going to use more than 500 watts.  After factoring in the other items I have on the UPS (2 monitors, a 5.1 channel receiver, cell phone charger), at maximum load I will be around 575-625 watts.  Shouldn't be a problem for a 750 watt UPS, right?

On this day I decided I wanted to see just how effective my computer would be with folding.  In case you're unaware, I'm referring to a research project by Stanford that simulates the folding of proteins and they ""farm out"" the work load.  If you Google search ""Folding@Home"" you will be able to find more information.  I prepare my computer for this, start up the GPU only clients, and walk away.  At this time, the GPUs are under intense load and are making a racket, so I close the door to the room to limit the noise, and do other things.  I return a while later to find my computer off.  Figuring there must have been something overheating, I let the machine cool for a few more minutes, and begin folding again, this time watching to see where the issue was.

It turns out that even though this UPS is rated at 750 watts, you cannot exceed about 600 watts before the UPS shuts off attached loads.  It does not matter whether or not you are on utility power or drawing from the battery.  The UPS has a cutoff point in the 600 watt range that it decides it is going to stop outputting power and will shut down.  Please note during this entire time, the UPS never attempted to switch to battery power, and the power was as problem free as utility power gets.  However I will grant that this is not a common load; I am drawing more power than most.  I still feel that if the UPS is rated at 750 watts, it should be able to supply 750 watts, especially while still drawing power from the wall.

That issue aside, this UPS performs admirably.  I previously had a UPS that was a more basic model--a stepped approximation of a sine wave, standby type UPS.  This UPS would cause my computer's power supply to whine whenever it was on battery power, and would not switch back to utility power whenever the power returned to normal.  This UPS has neither of those problems.  Due to the different types of switching technology, it also switches to battery faster, and doesn't switch as often.  It also has several features in the menu system that allow you to track power quality.  The PC software is not great if you're planning on using only one of these in a home environment, but makes more sense if you are planning on deploying several of these in an office type situation.  I would also appreciate the option to have the UPS just let the computer shut down hard if the battery runs all the way down, but can understand why this would not be desirable.  Personally, the reason I want a UPS is more to protect against brown-outs and low-voltage situations rather than black outs or complete power outages.

All that said, I want to reiterate I AM NOT A TYPICAL USER.  I am using the UPS in ways most people will not.  I have two upper mid-range/lower-high end graphics cards.  But I still feel this product should have been capable of supporting them.

I can't compare this screen protector to other anti-glare/anti-fingerprint screen protectors since I always get clear ones, but I wanted the anti-glare/anti-fingerprint features for an ipad that I would be using outside.  I don't feel like this product delivers on the anti-fingerprint qualities and only marginally has some anti-glare properties.  There are way too many negatives to recommend it.  I have purchased clear HD screen protectors from Tech Armor in the past and have been happy with them.  This particular item is not a good purchase.

My main gripes are
1) Everything on the screen is less clear because of the anti-glare feature.  My eyes feel like they are straining to focus the items on the screen.
2) The anti-glare function of the screen protector is only marginally effective.  I still see glare, although it is less than without the screen protector.
3) The screen protector is not smooth.  There is a friction when touching your finger to the screen.  You lose the feeling moving your finger on the screen and having it feel like glass.  This is probably normal for anti-glare screen protectors, but I didn't realize that I would hate it so much.
4) I can see just as many fingerprints as my other iPads that have the clear screen protector.  There is no reduction at all in my opinion.

Since it's a quiet environment already, I didn't want something that would seal out external noise, which is why I chose supra-aural. It still drops external sounds a little, so your co-workers having a conversation a couple offices over is muffled, leaving you aware of your environment, but able to enjoy your music without being distracted.

Their design looks very professional. They don't have the ""Look at me, I'm listening to headphones!"" appearance many of the modern designs have. The leather, steel, and glossy plastic make them look subdued but classy.

My one complaint, and the reason for subtracting a star is their comfort. Since they don't swivel horizontally (around the vertical axis), they apply pressure on the back part of your ears, which becomes uncomfortable after about 50 minutes of listening. I usually take a 5 minute break every hour to relieve the pressure they apply.

Sound is great; The highs are clear, the mids clean and the bass sufficient but not overwhelming. If you're a ""basshead"", these aren't your headphones, but if you want a balanced soundstage, these will suit your needs quite well.

Update 2:

I've been extremely busy with deadlines and I haven't found much time to update the review. Long story short, the second unit works wonders. I'm not sure what caused the first one to act wonky, but I even bought another Thunderbolt cable to try it out. After cycling power a few times between testing the first and second docks, with the first and second cables, I'm not sure what clicked, but it did. The second one works well 100% of the time and I've been able to be extremely productive with migrating my data exactly when and where I needed it with absolutely 0 problems. I wholeheartedly endorse this product and I sincerely appreciate CalDigit's attempt to reach out very promptly for a response. Thanks for what you did and thank you for an amazing dock that breathes new life into my Mac!

Update 1:
I received an exchange from Amazon on Wednesday and expected to test it out right away. Between work and other tasks, I wasn't able to do so. On Thursday, the 13th, I started working with this and I decided it was a marked improvement over the original unit I received. I had little time to use it between Thursday and Friday, so I'm just now getting around to posting an update on it. I started using my computer around noon today and I have to say that it was quite a pleasure for the first few minutes that it worked. Within the first few minutes, my external hard drive (the one I tested earlier) lost connection. I figured the cable or the power unit wasn't properly connected and I'd bother with it later. After taking a break from some reading, I took a look at it (my monitor was working the entire time). Around the 2 hour mark, the video started to go. The monitor started displaying a repeating flickering pattern, as described below. I tried unplugging the HDMI port and tested it again. Upon plugging it in again, the video would not display on my external monitor. I unplugged the thunderbolt cable several times and every single time, the external drive would automatically disconnect and the video would start to flicker, which is the same sequence of failure in the first unit. Now, the video doesn't work for more than a brief time (measured in the seconds, not minutes) and there seems to be no recourse for this. I'll try a few more things, but it looks like this unit is still a no/go.

Also, I updated my rating to reflect the actual pleasure of when the product was entirely functional. It was a pure pleasure to use it when it did work, but I'll think about my options once I troubleshoot it and identify any other possible issues.

Original review: First, I received this product three days ago. I was leaving town so I waited until this morning to try it. After restoring an image of a partition (via USB 3 to an SSD), I noticed that the USB 3 speeds weren't as high. My prior experience with restoring images from the same hard drive to an SSD were much faster on USB 2. I figured it was no big matter so I tried to restore the second image. Halfway through it, it said the cable was unplugged. Unfortunately for the dock, my MacBook pro, the SSD and all connections were intact on the ground where I started working. Since nothing moved, I figured it was some small internal error. I tried unplugging everything and plugging it in again (power to the Thunderbolt station, Thunderbolt cable on both ends, USB 3-SATA cable from the dock to the SSD, tried another USB 3-SATA cable, restarted the computer, and tried all configurations on another identical 2011 MacBook Pro) to no avail.

After realizing the USB 3 dream has been murdered, I decided to investigate whether it was the dock or the Thunderbolt cable. In the ""System Report"" of ""About this Mac"", I identified that there was indeed an active Thunderbolt connection that recognized everything until the thunderbolt station. No other devices past it were recognized. USB showed nothing more than the two USB 2.0 ports on the system.

I tried it many hours later and nothing has changed. It does not recognize USB 3 devices and USB 2 devices stopped working halfway through testing the next two tasks. Read on to find out more.

Score: 0/1

Then, I plugged it into the mini DisplayPort-HDMI adapter I had to connect to my external monitor. This was useless. It decided not to recognize anything and played dumb. In fact, all peripherals and cables were entirely functional when tested on both identical 2011 MacBook Pros before and after the Thunderbolt station. I tried again and waited for some time but it had remained unchanged the entire time. I figured I could set aside the mini DisplayPort-HDMI adapter for mobile use (in my work backpack) and try the HDMI input.

After many hours, I tried this connection again. What resulted astonished me: a completely functional display! Egads! This is incredible and deserves a permanent spot in my home. Alas! This wouldn't last as the connection resulted in endless flickering of the monitor on the left and right. I've waited for some time with it and absolutely nothing changed.

Score: 0/2

When I plugged in my HDMI cable, it works perfectly for less than a minute. Immediately afterwards, it goes out and the monitor does not receive an incoming signal at all. The cable works perfectly fine for any and all other tasks and the monitor's input has no issue displaying anything other than an HDMI connection from the Thunderbolt station to it.

The second trial after a break yielded no new results. The issue is still reproducible and the solution seems to be evading me.

Score: 0/3

As of now, I'll try returning it and I'll update the score when I receive a new functional dock.

Closing thoughts:
I've been EXTREMELY disappointed with this product, especially since I've been waiting for it since April 1st when they first announced it. After multiple delays, low inventory, etc., I'm still glad I got a chance to finally breathe some new life into my 2011 MacBook Pro. However, its inability to perform the simple task of working with USB 3 is its strongest failure. I'm sincerely disappointed in CalDigit and I truly hope they make an effort to revitalize this product. I haven't found a single reason not to exchange it for another unit, especially since it doesn't work. I'll give it another couple of hours before I try it again and decide whether it's ""functional enough"" to retain or exchange.

JULY 1 2014 UPDATE:
Last Friday, I was on the phone with CalDigit for quite some time. I made the first call around 9 PST after they opened and we (tech support and I) couldn't figure out how to fix the issue immediately. The issue was simple: when connected to my Mac, the BootCamp partition doesn't recognize that I have a wireless network connection and insists on ONLY connecting to the Internet through the Ethernet port on the dock. It also disabled the onboard wireless 802.11N adapter and continued forward pretending like all wireless connections were disabled. Multiple attempts to re-enable them did nothing and their own test MacBook Pro system didn't have the issue) so we had to identify the very specific quirk in my system that kept it from working.

I connected to the dock using a very long (but luckily, available) Ethernet cable and got on the phone with them. They remote diagnosed the issue with TeamViewer, stayed on the phone through multiple restarts to check off a long list (I assume they had one physically or in their heads) and the engineers at CalDigit (I could pick out 2-3 on the phone discussing gameplans on how to troubleshoot periodically) got on the phone throughout the entire process trying to troubleshoot the issue.

Eventually, we isolated the issue with older version of BootCamp (which also contained older drivers) and also disabled ZoneAlarm. Apparently, ZoneAlarm wasn't worth its weight in feces and kept me from working properly. 2 hours of brilliant, methodical and detail-oriented tech support resolved the issue and I can't thank them enough for it. I was apprehensive about making a tech support call for the Windows partition (let's be honest, we all are) but these guys went above and beyond to fix the issue. Based on recent interactions with some companies, I expected this level of tech support to be on some paid tier with extended warranty, but their quality of support rocks.

All I have to say now is that I hope they build on this support and deliver on it. I'm strongly considering expanding into their other offerings for my next few upgrades. Thanks, CalDigit!","CalDigit, listen up: outstanding product (and customer service) for a tremendous price!",1391990400,

I was not blown away by the speed. Looking at the specs, I was under the distinct impression that I was going to see an improvement in the accessing of files, both on the local computer, and across the network. I may have seen some improvement, but nothing spectacular.

This is an excellent cooler.
I run an i7 6700K, and I've never gotten it above 60C even under stress tests, and that's with the fans at minimum speed AND the heatsink paste that came pre-applied with it. At full speed the fans are rather loud, so if you're in a warm room they might get a bit noisy. The radiator also likes to collect dust, but that's probably just par for the course, a compressed air can cleans it out in no time flat.
It's totally sealed, so you don't need to worry about filling, leaks, cleaning the internals, buying all the fittings, bending pipe, or replacing individual parts.

Now onto the bad and the ugly.
I bought this version because of the Corsair Link functionality, but sadly I'm personally not impressed. It crashes all the time for me, and the cooler doesn't ""Remember"" it's settings. If I set it in the software to run the fans at full speed constantly and light the logo up red and then restart the PC, it forgets those settings until you launch the software again.
You also NEED the software running to adjust the cooler's settings.
I'm also not a fan of using up a USB header on the motherboard to connect the pump permanently for the software, a basic USB cable coupled with the cooler remembering your settings, or at least the ability to choose between this or the header, would have been a better implementation for me.

Since that software is just another dead load on my PC when it runs in the background, and it didn't work too well for me in the first place, I moved the fans to motherboard control.
They're standard 4-pin fan connectors and normally plug into the pump, but you can disconnect them and just use a motherboard plug and fan splitter if you have 4-pin connectors on both. The pump runs at full speed by default, so you really don't need the software by any means.

If you don't mind the software, this is a great cooler if you're intimidated by the concept of making your own cooling system like me; just hook it up and it performs very well.",I'm a fan of these fans. Just not the software.,1489449600,

Unlike the hacked mics that plug into the charge port(not available for the 2g anyway yet) the Tunebuds is very lightweight. The ear buds themselves are very stable in your ear, it does not come off easily like most of us have experienced with the IPod earphones  (very bad). ItuneBuds does come with different size buds. It is almost total noise isolating. The cord is nylon, unlike anything I have ever seen before. It's different, I'don't know if it's better, but I've noticed it is easier to untangle than a regular rubbery cord.

Now the Mic is the greatest feature of this device, and I love it for being so unexpensive and cool looking. You can use Griffin's app for the Ipod touch, or any other voice recording app. Most of which are free from the app store. One I highly recommend is Evernote.

The recording quality of the Mic is great, it's not perfect but it sounds like a cell phone call. Pretty great for the price. I use it a lot to create little reminders and to - dos. I can name the files whatever I want and choose what quality recording I would like. Very nifty.

The button on the Mic works as a control for your music player as well. Hit one play/pause. Twice skip forward, 3 times skip backwards. I just love being able to do that without having to tap my way into the music player everytime I need to skip a song or pause for a second. It works from any application you're in as long as the application doesn't have music audio (youtube, tap tap revenge) The music stops automatically.

Now the thing that I bought this mic for and really Amazes me for the coolness of being able to do it is making Voip calls with it. I use it with skype and wlm to make call when I'm on a hotspot. That works like magic it's unbelievable and I love that. The people tell me they can hear me well and that makes me proud of my purchase.

When this computer went on sale for less than I could by a comparable components (mATX/mITX motherboard, i3-6100, 8GB RAM, etc, AND Windows 10 licence) I knew this was the route I was going to take.

Does this rig work for editing photos? Yes! I thought the low-power Sandy Bridge architecture from my 2011 iMac was doing just fine until I imported about 100 raw files into Capture One on this machine. My jaw dropped. It handled each 16MB RAW file as quickly as my old machine worked with plain jpgs. I went to Userbenchmark.com and it appears that the high clock speed of the i3-6100's dual cores combined with the well above average I/O of the 2TB HDD combine to make it more responsive than you'd think a machine at this price point would be. I'm not saying it's as responsive as some of the SSD machines I've worked on, because it's not, but this HDD is fast enough that you aren't searching the couch cushions for change to buy an SSD as an immediate upgrade.

Does this rig work for editing video? I don't know......yet. The HDD is definitely large enough for most 1080p work, but I haven't had a chance to edit anything since I've only had this computer for about a week now and I've been busy trying to catch up on editing all the photos of the past three months.

Conclusion:
This is the machine to get if you need a photo work station and you're on a budget. If you desire a really responsive machine, get the Crucial MX300 M.2 (2280) SSD which works with the SATA-only M.2 slot on the motherboard. I paid $350 (on 2016-12-22) for this and at the time nothing was all that close when it came to pace and space, even if I built it myself.","Fast enough to edit photos rapidly, not reliable enough for regular use!",1483574400,

The sound quality of this new pair sounds good enough for my non-audiophile ears, and the cloth-covered cord seems nice and sturdy.  But holy cow, I can't stand the way these rest on my ears.

The problem isn't that these squeeze my head like a vice; leaving them stretched out overnight (or maybe a week or two) can tame them well enough.  The main problem is that the hooks dig in over my ears, and the outer rim of the earpieces dig into my ears too.  Look at the picture; the inner black padding compresses when you wear it, which leaves the not-remotely-round-edged gray plastic rim pressing into your ear-flesh (unless your ears are no larger than a quarter, in which case they will fit neatly within the cushioned area).

My previous pair had cloth all the way around the back sides of the earpieces (where the gray rim is on these), which made them really comfortable (and yet that model was rated terribly for comfort -- wha?).  Of course, that side cloth was what wore out so readily on my old pair...  At this point, though, I think I'd prefer low-durability comfort.

Over the years, I have grown to despise Cablevision here in NY - for denying millions the NY Yankees for a whole season - and for constantly raising their rates while arrogantly lowering their service quality. I used their SA 8300 HD DVR for 4 years and grew to like it for mostly conceptual reasons. However, I concluded that for $10 a month plus the $6.50 receiver charge, it was woefully lacking in sensible features. It also routinely failed to record shows that were programmed and required a high degree of management by the user. I finally decided to try an HD Tivo this year. I purchased a standard HD Tivo and, like some other great products, asked myself ""Why didn't I do this years ago??"" After two visits from Cablevision, including one tech who was a complete incompetent, the cable card was installed and I began using the Tivo. I got the lifetime service subscription and use a wirelsss G adapter. I would advise anyone who makes this purchase to plug in and install the Tivo 2-3 days before your cable company comes to install the card. It will take a day or two for the unit to get firmware upgrades needed for the cable card to function properly. My favorite features are the ability to program your recordings online, the Season Pass feature, and Tivo suggestions. Additionally, Tivo service offers the user the ability to search for programs by keywords, actor, or director. I am completely blown away by the features that merge the DVR with the internet. For those who like cable tv's ""on demand"" services, fret not: As a Netflix subscriber, I can watch any movies or programs that are available as ""Watch Instantly."" Though the picture quality is not HD, there are thousands of documentaries and older movies that I can watch when picture quality is not a priority. To summarize, Tivo is a quantum leap over current cable company-issued DVRs. It's like comparing the Model-T Ford to the Starship Enterprise. I will purchase an additional Tivo when the tuning adapter issue is settled. I also use a Western Digital My DVR Expander, for a total capacity of about 93 hours of HD recording capacity. If you're wondering about my total HT setup, I use the Tivo HD with a Sharp Aquos 42 1080P, a Sony Blu-ray 350S, and a Bose Lifestyle V30 HT system. Bottom line, the cable card costs $2 per month, so I don't have to pay Cablevision $14.50 per month. After about 3 years, I am ahead cost wise with the $399 lifetime subscription. Liberate yourself from your arrogant cable company. There are so many better choices out there. Without a doubt, I love this product and will never, ever go back to Cablevision's crappy, expensive equipment. If you watch lots of TV and lead a busy life, the Tivo HD is a fantastic product and a great value. I highly recommend it!!!",Liberating!,1235088000,

I really like the modular drive bays that can be reconfigured to work well for your setup.  The watercooling potential for this case is great (still on air at the moment) if you are willing to do some minimal modifications.  With mods you can fit a 360 radiator in the top and a 140 in the front, should be enough for all but the most extreme benchmarking systems.  The included fans are nice enough, they are quiet and move a lot of air for the noise level.  The fan controller works well enough, actually my setup runs very cool at the lowest fan setting so I don't really need to turn it up ever.

On to the cons of this case, they are not deal breakers but should be noted before buying this case.  The first is that this case hasn't been update since it was released.  Unfortunately that means that there is only 1 USB 3.0 port on the front of the case and that it is connected via a pass through cable that needs to be routed to the back of your motherboard.  Obviously this isn't a huge deal but I just feel like it would be easy to update to a internal header.  What I ended up doing is getting a header (the Anker Uspeed USB 3.0 3.5 inch Front Panel with 2 USB 3.0 Ports Hub) and mounted that in a drive bay and connected everything up.  Ended up very clean but I still wish it had a additional port on the front.

One more thing to note, the black 600T that I am reviewing is the mesh version of the case and does not include the window.  The description here was misleading (copy and paste from either the silver or white) and said it included both the window and mesh insert but it does not...Unfortunately I was forced to buy a windowed panel at an additional cost because that is what I wanted.  There is no black version that includes the window at this point, I think that is a mistake on the part of Corsair.  If you buy this case and the window it should come out to the same price but the shipping will cost you extra so it ends up being more expensive.  If they offered the window without a complete side panel it would be much better, unfortunately at this time they do not offer just the window and hardware for some reason.

After I got everything and paid for the window I am still happy with this case.

LIKES
* Overall image quality is good.  Considering the conditions in which you can shoot with this (wet, cold, hot, dusty, etc.), I'd rate image quality as very good.
* Low-light performance.  Most of the underwater pictures I've shot were in the pool in the evening with no direct sunlight.  Given the lighting conditions, the images far exceed a typical point-and-shoot.  Considering they were shot underwater (taking away quite a bit more light), the increased challenges of automatic focusing, etc. and I'd rate the image quality fantastic.
* Form factor.  A little awkward, but fun and easy to hold & use once you get the hang of it.  The included strap is well done, rugged, and can easily cinch tight on your wrist for times when you are in the water or in other settings that might make keeping hold of it a challenge.
* Video quality.  Excellent!  I've been shooting videos in full HD and watching them on my 42"" HDTV.  The quality far exceeds what I expected.
* LCD.  It is 3"", bright, and easy to use underwater.
* Battery life.  Very good considering it has no optical viewfinder, meaning the LCD is constantly on.
* Zoom.  Haven't played with this too much, but the wide range on this camera makes this quite versatile.
* Exposure.  One pleasant surprise is how quickly and how well the exposure adjusts to/from underwater and out of the water lighting.  It does have a dedicated underwater setting, which might further improve my underwater shots, but Auto works great if you are moving back & forth often.

DISLIKES
* Very limited manual controls.  On the plus side, the Auto mode works well, and how much do you really want to fumble with manual settings while underwater or in other challenging settings?
* Price.  Yes, it is a bit too expensive for everyone to grab one.  But $ for $, this is a fantastic bargain for a high-quality rugged, waterproof camera.
* Limited flash control.  Most point-and-shoots nowadays allow you to force the flash to fire, which can be really helpful at eliminating shadows, among other things.  In Auto mode, you can't do this (though it might be possible when you use other modes).  On the plus side, it does so well in low light that this is less of an issue.
* It is not the best all-around point-and-shoot camera.

My S95 produces FAR superior images and offers full manual control.  BUT... what you are paying for with the D20 is something that you can knock around, drop, take in the water, use in the rain or snow, etc. and not worry about.

If you are an outdoor enthusiast and find yourself missing a lot of shooting opportunities because the conditions aren't safe for a regular point-and-shoot, I don't think you can much better than this.  I thought of just using my S95 and getting an underwater housing for it, but those are costly.  The D20 is capable of great shots, especially in tough conditions (see some of my samples from time in a pool), and is easy to grab at a moment's notice.  And that fact that it is rugged makes me a lot more willing to allow my kids to shoot with it.

After doing a lot of research, this is the laptop that was the cheapest for what it had and it's a Dell, so I figured it would have decent build quality. It was either this one
(Dell Inspiron i7559-2512BLK) with a 1tb hdd hybrid and an i7 processor, or the other Inspiron with a 250gb ssd and an i5. I went for the former because of the better processor and the fact that I don't really care if I have an ssd. It was only 35 dollars more.

So after installing an additional 8gb of ram, updating the laptop and downloading many gigs worth of games, I was finally ready to play. I'm impressed with what this laptop can play. The most graphical intensive games I have are Witcher 3, GTA 5 and Bioshock Infinite. It played GTA 5 at 60fps on high settings and the Witcher 3 at 60fps on low settings and the resolution lowered. I haven't played Bioshock Infinite yet on it, but I'm sure it can play it no problem. As you can see, it struggled on the Witcher 3, but it's still playable. I think it's safe to say this laptop can play most games that are out today and can play older AAA titles at max settings.

I honestly was surprised at how nice it looks and feels in person. I don't buy many laptops, but I think it looks really cool and I personally like the matte finish it's case has. I do agree with those that say the keyboard and track pad could've been better though, but they're not terrible by any means. Iv'e also seen some people complain about the brightness, but I think it's max brightness is barely good enough. I haven't tried using it in the sun, but I love the anti glare screen. It may not look as good as other screen, but I really hate glare and this screen is fine. I wold say for the price, the build quality and screen are good. Really no complaints here.

I only got this laptop 2 days ago but so far it's been a great machine for the price. It has enough storage, a decent graphics card that can handle most games, a fast processor, good build quality and the battery isn't terrible by any means (probably at least 5 hours on battery saver while browsing and watching videos or 1-2 while gaming).

The volume limiter that comes with the headphones is a separate, intermediary cable. There are pros and cons: If the plug gets broken (as ours did) you can get a replacement without replacing the headphones, and you can also use it to limit the volume on any other pair of standard headphones. On the other hand, it can get lost or separated from your headphones. Kids who have figured out how it works can also remove the cable and plug their headphones back in directly.

The volume limiter is effective without reducing the sound to an inaudible whisper. The sound is loud enough to be heard clearly and comfortably.

The .Audio 995 is fantastic and I am extremely satisfied with my decision. After the initial charge, the headset worked immediately on my Windows 7 laptop after simply plugging in the dongle. The audio quality is terrific, much better than the quality speaker setup I had been using. I've used the headset with all sorts of applications without any issues whatsoever including iTunes, VLC media player, Mumble, Skype, Rosetta Stone -- you name it. Skype and Mumble contacts say the quality is better than my old Logitech ClearChat wired headset.

I've tested the range of the headset and the 40 feet is a fair estimate of what you'll get. I got more than 40 feet via line-of-sight and found that through standard walls and whatnot, 40 feet was pretty much the minimum. If the connection is lost, it pops right back in when you get within range.

A few things that came up in other reviews are worth mentioning. While I found the headset well-adjustable for head-size, I can probably agree that wearing it for the full six hour charge might be a bit uncomfortable. A couple of hours? No problem.

The fact that it cannot charge while being worn keeps this from being perfect. Look, it's a bummer, but it's a known bummer. Manage your battery and all is well.

Also, yeah, don't misplace the dongle -- or the tiny charging cable if you don't have extras.

First, I understand that with these flat panel displays it's challenging for manufacturers to find a place to put the speakers. Best I can tell they have them pointing directly down from the plastic panel. Unfortunately if you have the TV in say, an old-style entertainment stand, this causes a really tinny echoy sound.

I hooked a couple of PC speakers to the headset port and improved the TVs sound dramatically. But for what you pay for an HDTV, you shouldn't have to do this.

Second, Haier is offering a discount on a Roku Streaming Stick as a promotion. I'd like to point out this is slightly misleading. The $10 discount is ONLY applicable to the Streaming Stick for MHL - which is some sort of funky mobile version of HDMI. Technically this is nice because MHL carries power so you don't need to hook it up to USB for power.

My two problems with this is that first, the MHL streaming stick costs $69, not the $49 of the regular streaming stick - so you're actually not saving money. Even after the $10 discount you're still spending more. Second, if you have another TV that doesn't have this funky new port that no one's ever heard of, well, you're out of luck. Your fancy Roku won't work with it. This coupon code is ONLY applicable to the MHL version so don't be fooled - make sure you know what you're getting if you choose to take advantage of it.

If the sound was a teensy bit better and the streaming stick discount was applicable to ANY roku purchase, this would be five stars for sure.

Edit 4/3/14:
By the way if you bought this TV and the sound changes unexpectedly, check the audio menu and check to see if ""Auto Volume"" is on. If it is, turn it off. This should fix your sound issue.","Nice TV, almost five stars",1396396800,

I had a chance to buy the Monster Turbines during the Deal of the Day last year for $59 and I bought 2 pairs at that time. (one was a gift). At that price, I'd buy them again and again and here's why:

-Sound Quality: Overall very clear and warm sounding. Bass is definitely emphasized and exaggerated but not muffled like in cheaper headphones. These are great for Bass-heavy music like Rock, R&B, Reggae, etc. The mids and especially the highs take a bit of a backseat to the Lows. I would describe the sound as a ""good mood"" listening. It just puts a smile on your face. It's not your ""pinky out sophisticate audiophile"" headphone. Ultimate Ears are more ""balanced"" but hence they lack the ""warmth"" of Monster Turbines.

-Fit and Comfort: They are rather small and don't stick out of the ear. The sound chamber itself is narrower than other in-ear headphones, which is good because it allows the ear tip to have more ""wiggle room"" as it conforms to the shape of your ear canal. Turbines come with a choice of silicone tips and I like them so much, that I use Monster tips on my TripleFi's. Turbines are heavy (metal) but that doesn't bother me much. Are they going to stay in if you run around? - I don't know. I think running and sweating in a pair of $150 headphones is silly.

-Build: Solid. No issues with cables either.

-Packaging: Very nice. Carrying case a little silly though and looks like a cheap kids wallet.

I am giving them 4.5 stars. It would be 5 stars if they brought out the mids and highs and kept that warm bass going.","Great Buy if under $100, Solid Build, Bass",1296604800,

Take really great photos and the best thing is it's really easy to use. I don't have to spend 2 hours reading a stupid manual to find out what are the options.

Everything about this camera is simple, I was shocked at how easy I can flip through options to change as I see fit.

I am still to check out exactly how many pics the battery can handle before needing a recharge but I took a week fiddling around with the camera, took videos and pics, changing options, playing back the video on the television etc before the battery needed a recharge.

This camera doesn't have a stupid time limit on videos, the length of the video depends on the space you have on the SD card, the 2gb card I have in give me about 1hr 10mins of video time which is great.

The overall construction quality is very good  The +20db setting means you can lower your camera's internal gain and use the SMX-15 to amplify the signal for crisp, hiss free audio.  The mounting system is well designed and isolates the microphone from normal camera handling noise.  Importantly, the microphone doesn't sound thin and hollow like cheap microphones do.  That being said the high pass filter, if used, will naturally eliminate some of the low end resonance of a speaker.  You may want to use this feature selectively or apply a high pass filter in post if your software provides this feature.

I would say this is a great option for vlogging with it mounted on your camera, or shooting video where you want some ambient audio but plan on using a music soundtrack in the foreground (like a skater video), or in a quieter controlled environment where you can put the mic on a boom stand (you will need a 3.5mm extensional cable for the microphone) to mic one or two people talking.  It did not want to have to mess with recording audio separately and then syncing it later so this is a great option for me.  Head to head competitors for this mic are the Rode VideoMic Pro and the Sure VP83 and VP83F.  I personally prefer this mic for its more faithful and accurate sound reproduction.  I can still eq to taste if I need to, but it gives me a real quality signal to start with.

I really like the auto setting that turns the mic on when you camera turns on and turns the mic off when your camera is turned off.  However, this only worked on my Panasonic G7, not the Canon camcorder.  With the Canon I had to still remember to turn the mic on and off each time.

When I bought it I also purchased a case for the iPad directly from Apple as well... which cost $80 at the time.  It worked, but not worth the $80 in my opinion.

Through the last 5 years of using the iPad Air the case eventually wore down to the point where I try to stand the iPad up in the case but it just slides out of the case.  Obviously this was just normal wear and tear over 5 years of using my iPad, but still not worth paying $80 to get the case from Apple in my opinion.

Review:  This iPad case over is great!  For one thing it's much cheaper than buying a case from Apple. Secondly it also locks into place on your iPad vs Apples iPad cover which also fit good on the iPad but it didn't lock into place.  When I say it locks into place you can hear all four corners snap into place, so you know your getting a very secure case and tight case.  This iPad case doesn't cover up the speakers or around the charging port at the bottom of the iPad Air where as Apple's iPad case does.  Because of this it's also easier to listen on the iPad when not using headphones and also makes it a little bit easier to plug in when you need to charge your iPad.  I should also mention that this case also has the magnetic strip for when you want to stand the case up.  One thing this case does lack is that it doesn't cover over the buttons on the iPad.  With that being said the buttons are still easily accessible even with the case on.

Pros:
1.  Cost significantly less than Apple's iPad Air cases
2.  Snaps into place for a very secure fit
3.  Doesn't cover the speakers on the bottom of the iPad
4.  Has magnetic strip to keep the case in position when standing it up

Cons:
1.  Since it snaps so securely into the iPad it could make some small marks on the corners of the iPad
2.  The case doesn't cover any of the buttons on the iPad (volume up, volume down, power button)",Fits perfectly on iPad Air 1st Generation,1531612800,

That's worth extra $$ to me, but for a ring with a hole, 144 bucks? For that price I'd better be able to do some decent macro work!

The good news is, this thing works better than I thought. I use a 50mm/1.2 on a 5D Mark III and I cannot get closer than a foot or so to an object before I run out of focus when using just the lens. With this ring added on, I can get right on top of something, even an inch away and still get it in focus. That was my biggest concern and now I'm thrilled. For bug eyes you have to get too close to the object which would scare the bug away, so next I'll try this on my 70-200 and see how that works (out on loan to a friend at the moment). I'll update after I try that.

I posted a pic that shows both the regular 50mm at closest focus, and the same shot with the EF25 tube added. Look for the image from ""PD"".
