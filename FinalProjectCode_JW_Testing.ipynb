      "Message: I researched quite a bit to find this case and had purchased another that is not big enough.  This Op/Tech pouch perfectly fits my Canon 5D Mark III with EF 24-70mm f2.8 lens attached (hood stored inverted) without a battery grip.  I had my wife modify this case however to accommodate my Carry Speed FS-Pro Camera Sling Strap w/ foldable mounting plate (FS-PRO) which has the swivel ball offset from center just about 3/4\" on the bottom.  (PS:  the Carry Speed strap system is great! and you have to buy them outside of the USA).  I wanted a protective cover/pouch to go over the camera when I am carrying it on the bus and train, etc.. when traveling.  Also to help with closure she sewed in 2 strips of velcro down each side of the back closure.  The velcro will help keep it closed with the Carry Speed strap system attached and also will be easier than the Op/Tech snap closure.  This pouch will last for years and protect this expensive body and lens.\n",

      "\n",
      "I've been using the bag with a Micro Four Thirds system based around a Panasonic GM5 camera body and 3 lenses (usually the 12-32 and 35-100 compact zooms with an Olympus prime) and it's almost perfectly sized for that setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "FEATURES:\n",
      "\n",
      "Size/weight: Is excellent for the smaller mirrorless cameras as it can hold a full 3-lens system, covering most shooting situations. Other users have reported satisfaction with medium-sized mirrorless bodies such as the Olympus PEN and Sony NEX cameras with 2-3 lenses. The bag is nice and light at 265g (according to my postal scales) when kitted out with the strap and rain-cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design: Is mostly great. There are a lot of thoughtful design touches, including: a smartphone sleeve and two SD card-holders built into the internal divider; a battery compartment under the lid; a front zip-pocket with internal pouch; lid zips that are cleverly positioned so as not to pose a scratch hazard to expensive gear; a rain cover; a detachable strap that can be used over the shoulder or as a belt; a top handle on the lid; nylon padding on high-abrasion points (such as the points where the metal strap lugs rub against the bag); and gear sleeves on both ends of the bag (one of which stretches to give more space).\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality: The bag is made in Vietnam, I believe. Build quality is very good, with excellent stitching and heavy-duty YKK zips. The main bag's shell seems to be made from nylon. Coming from a Billingham, nylon seems a bit cheap but is acceptable at this price point. Padding is thin, but adequate for lightweight camera gear (I wouldn't want to drop it onto concrete though ...). The strap is also nylon, but it seems to have smoother edges than some other nylon straps I have used and it does not cut into my shoulder like they do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usage: I've been very happy with the way this bag handles. I always seem to be able to access my gear quickly and easily. It's a fast bag to open, making quick lens-changes a breeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quibbles:\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I don't like about the bag is the way it handles weather-sealing. This is achieved in a fiddly manner by pulling a rain cover over the bag in such a way that it is awkward to use the straps (they jut out the back) and which makes the bag's interior inaccessible. The cover is inconvenient to stow as it occupies all of the space in one of the end pockets, reducing the usable space in this already-small bag. My larger bag is a top-quality Billingham Hadley Small that uses a wide, waterproof canvas lid to keep top of the bag covered and which retains all of its functions in wet conditions. I much prefer the Billingham approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another small quibble is that I think some of the bag's features are overkill. Examples: 1) the SD card pouches built into the internal divider tend to catch on lens hoods / camera parts, and I am considering unstitching and removing them; 2) the hefty metal strap links are bigger and heavier than they need to be. I would prefer a lighter attachment system, with the weight savings going towards better-quality waterproof materials and a wider lid to solve the weatherproofing issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are one or two very minor issues with the lid. Firstly, it leaves most of the top zip exposed to weather. As already mentioned, I would prefer the lid to be wider and made of waterproof material to cover access points and make the raincover redundant. Secondly, the lid attaches to the front of the bag with a magnet. This is preferable to velcro, but in my opinion the magnet is a little too weak for a lid that has a carry-strap built into it. This is not an issue if you remember to zip the lid to the body, but if you forget to do that and grab the bag by the lid strap, there's a good chance the bag will open. Most likely none of your gear will fall out, but it is a possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, the bag is great and I'm pleased with my purchase.\n",

      "Message: For years we carried two sets of binoculars on our bird and wildlife watching outings.  One set for long distance viewing, and another for things closer. But no more!  The handy zoom feature of these binoculars takes care of all our viewing needs in one package. The optics are sharp and clear. We recently took them along on a snowmobile tour in Yellowstone, and this sturdy set of binos stood up to a couple hundred miles of bumpy, jarring riding, and endured the cold. They are relatively light weight considering their size.  Our only complaint is we wish they had come with a better carry case and a different eyepiece cap. The case itself has no carry strap, (the bino strap laced to the outside of the bag serves as a carry strap). The case does have a belt loop, but it is really much too large to be carried on the waist comfortably.  So once you remove the binoculars from the case for use, there is no way easy way to secure the case out of the way.  The eyepiece cap is rather useless...it constantly falls off.  The cap does have a way to secure it to the strap, but it doesn't work out if you're using the strap as a carry strap while the item is within its case. The case is also VERY tight fitting, and makes it difficult to remove the binocs quickly for use. For just a few more pennies in materials, they could have come up with a better carry/storage system.\n",

      "Message: I had separate remotes for AVR, Blu Ray, VHS, 2 TV's, Cable Box, Laptop Computer, 2 Amazon devices, Cassette Player... it was a bit of a nightmare.  The AVR and cable box remotes were \"universal\" types but never did a good job, neither would recognize all of my many different brand and ages of hardware, and when they did \"see\" a particular device the controls were limited to basic functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "My AVR and all of the source devices are housed in a rack built through the wall about 3 feet to the side of the TV.  I have often experienced annoying line-of-sight issues with the big pile of various remotes I needed to use.  From several seating positions in the room the IR signals would be blocked by furniture and I'd have to stand up and point the remotes to get them to control the recessed devices.  Sometimes I want a different look and have the TV on a different wall well away from the built-in component rack.  Pointing the AVR remote (which also controlled TV volume and source selection) at the TV in that situation didn't work, and when it was pointed at the AVR on a different wall then the left/right up/down 'circle' control changed orientation and became less intuitive to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guests unfamiliar with the setup were often stumped, my settings have been unintentionally changed (grrr) by those simply wanting to change channels, adjust volume, or when (for example) trying to play music from a CD, tuner, i-tunes, turntable, Pandora, cassette, phone, memory stick, Amazon Prime, or the open reel deck.  With a complex system like this this it can really, really screw things up when inputs & outputs at the AVR and TV get changed/rerouted.  I needed a powerful but simple to operate solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just yesterday I received the Harmony Ultimate.  It included a rechargeable hand held remote control, a charger base, an RF/IR/Bluetooth \"hub\", wall warts for the charger base & hub, 2 external IR transmitters with long cables, a USB cable to connect the remote to a computer (for initial setup purposes only) and an intelligible well written fold open poster instruction sheet.  The packaging was very upscale, more like a thick cigar box than the thin cardboard most things come in, I'll keep it against any future need to store or transport.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I go into details... I already LOVE LOVE LOVE this thing!\n",
      "\n",
      "The setup of hardware and software can be done by the average non-tech type. It takes a bit of time and REQUIRES a computer connected to the internet, preferably in the same room as your TV and other hardware.  I used a laptop connected to my wireless network and all went smoothly.  You will need to be connected to your WIRELESS network (no hard wired ports on the hub) to make any future settings or programming changes.  Day to day use does not require the wireless network, someone with a mobile hot spot could do the setup if you don't have wireless internet access.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remote and the hub work together, both are required for the remote to operate.  The hub is the 'brain' that stores your settings and sends the commands to your hardware.  The remote is the control interface, it does a very good job of mirroring ALL of my original remotes, but there were a couple small functions that I couldn't easily duplicate.  There is a custom setup menu that allows you to assign different functions to the remote buttons, these custom settings will change depending on the device you are controlling.  I think I'll be able to program the missing functions if they prove needed.  You can also get an app for your Apple or Android device, I put it on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and found it to be extremely useful.  The controls look/operate differently in the app then on the remote, and they seem to list ALL native functions by scrolling through different pages... as many as needed for any particular device.  I prefer the app for some functions such as switching screen aspects on my TV, using the app I can select the different aspects in any order from a list instead of having to scroll through.  This enables me (finally) to make a direct A/B comparison of any two aspects instead of having to see the others first as I scroll through, which previously made such comparisons very difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most remotes are IR (infrared) types, they utilize IR light and require an unblocked line of sight. Some remotes are RF (Radio Frequency) which can go through walls.  THIS version of the Harmony Ultimate Remote is RF, the hub and remote use RF to communicate, I can sit anywhere and point anywhere and it works.  The hub and the TWO extra transmitters cover my room very well, all of the IR based hardware responds just like I was pointing the native remote right at it.  There is another Harmony Ultimate that does not use RF, it costs less and might be suitable for some users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the cool part... along with gaining FULL independent control of all your hardware from a single remote, you can also create \"activities\".  Want to watch TV?  During the setup you tell the Harmony remote to turn on (for example) your TV, cable box, and AVR.  Thereafter, all you have to do is press \"Watch TV\" in the activities menu on the remote and all the correct hardware will activate.  Change your mind? Just press (for example) \"Watch a Movie\" and the cable box will deactivate, your DVD player will turn on, all the correct inputs will be selected, and the remote will now be controlling the DVD, all with the press of of a single \"button\".  If you want to concurrently operate any of your other devices, you can always switch them on and off and control them from the devices menu without affecting the current \"activity\".  Maybe you want to start the TV at a lower volume than the default selected on the AVR... simply create a new activity that just turns on the TV and cable box without the receiver being activated, have the default volume on the TV set low and you'll be listening through the TV speakers instead of your sound system, you can then name it \"TV Low Volume\"... or anything else you choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, now you have your activities programmed and you've also programmed your favorite channels (up to 50 of them).  Pick up the remote, press any favorite channel icon on the touch display (which turns on when you move the remote, and, the physical buttons become backlit at your preferred intensity... way cool).  All the right hardware activates and you even go directly to the selected channel, very slick!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hurrah... all past remote control issues have been resolved, and my guests can operate things without creating headaches!\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I don't like, and I REALLY don't like it, is the method of programming and organizing your channels.  The 'drag & drop function is at best clunky, and, the naming function is lacking and inflexible.  Takes 5x longer than it should to program favorite channels.  Why such a big flaw on an otherwise excellent device?  Because this doesn't affect day-to-day use, and because the rest is SO good, I'm making this a 5 star review.\n",

While the NFLIGHT is made of top notch materials, the packaging is excessive and most importantly, the Headphone Adapter doesn't work as expected. There are surprisingly few airplane headphone adapters on Amazon so I ordered this one with the hope of saving myself the grief of dealing with low quality junk. I was wrong. My previous headphone adapter came with a pair of Klipsch x10 earphones and it worked fabulously on various airlines with every make and model of earphone/headphone that I tried. I only bought the TYLT as a replacement after a passenger accidentally destroyed my previous one. (Lesson Learned: Always Detach the Headphone Adapter from the Armrest If You're Leaving Your Seat)\n",

      "I've tried the TYLY NFLIGHT Airplane Adapter on a EVA Boeing 777 on both Business and Economy classes, and I also tried it on an JAL Airbus A330 in Economy, and NFLIGHT failed to perform on all occasions. The problem is that sound cuts out on one side if you insert headphones all the way in. The remedy is to pull the headphones about ~2-3mm out after inserting them. As a premium priced Airplane Headphone Adapter, this is unacceptable. These are supposedly covered by TYLT's 1-year warranty so I will try to claim manufacturer defect and see how the exchange process is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: Jan 26, 2016\n",
      "I lost my TYLY NFLIGHT a couple of weeks ago so I didn't try to claim warranty service. I've since purchased several Bose QuietComfort headphones airline adapters after I found that they work quite well but are kind of bulky. A side benefit of the Bose airline adapters is that they feature passive attenuation such that you'll need to turn the volume of the airline entertainment system up higher to listen at normal levels. This boosts the signal to noise ratio and results in cleaner sound.\n",

      "Message: Yes this thing out shines the ipod in audio quality and features mostly Audiophiles care about. Ok so I've been in the mainstream audio far too long and if it wasn't for my recent new hobby listening to music again after 20 years HQ High resolution music this thing makes it all portable and a way to take it to work and not look like an IED waiting to go off! Now I'll try to explain the sound, for me coming from 10 iPods where I would describe them being 720 resolution and the Fiio X3 it like 1080 High Def. Ok so with the sound quality out of the way what about the user interface, the iPods are very easy to use and very refined in that snapple knows what works and has an army of programmers to do all the customization they want. The Fiio first and foremost is a music player and very good at audio so it seems like an after though on a couple of features like gap less playback, for me it works fine and every now and then there is a small blip between tracks so not a deal breaker. Some bugs are known like with fast forwarding in a song might keep playing in a different spot than where the dot is on the screen but has not happened to me so I guess it's like a poorly encoded video where the sound doesn't match the lips your watching. I know if anyone is reading this they may have read up on the quirks elsewhere as there are sights more in tune to documenting the feedback on this thing so I'll stop with this. I read the Cnet review last, purchased from Amazon and won't be sending it back because it SOUNDS THIS GOOD! I can replace the battery myself because I can without killing the back cover it's GOT SCREWS! I can take an unlimited amount of music I want with me(micro SDXC are TINY) and supports 128gb to boot take that snapple! 24/192 bit file support is HQ and I'm not sure my Note 3 can even handle them. Not interested yet? We'll there is a track on the built in 8gb memory Dr. Chesky amazing fabulous Album too long for me to remember that comes with all x3's I think it's left and right audio test where the good Dr. Whispers in the Binaural dummy ear and on my HD700's you can almost feel his breath as he's whispers as if he was right next to your ear \"MIND BLOWN\" it freaked me out and I played it again to make sure it wasn't just something I could hear but I actually felt the waves of his speach touching my ears and was in total shock as in none of my iPods never made me get goosebumps. For ~200 bux this thing gives me more fun than 2 year passes at the local theme park and I don't even need to touch the road rage laden highways to get there lol!\n",

      "Message: First off this camera is pretty much junk. It uses an .avi container and does not really record in HD reguardless of what the listing or package says. It more then likely uses the Novatek NT96220FG. This chipset can only do 720P 30fps. The1080P is interpolation and at 25FPS. It also does not support WDR, and that makes it useless at night giving it no \"night vision\". The little LED on the side does nothing but cause glass reflection and glare at night making things even worse. I wanted to double check the specs so I recorded a few videos. I could not get the properties to show in Windows so I ran a clip through Corel Video Studio and got a bit rate of 2057.19 kpbs or roughly 2MB using MJPEG compression at 25FPS with a file size of 95MB per 1 min clip on the 1080P setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the 720P setting I get a bitrate of 1390.48 kbps roughly 1.3MB at 30FPS These are extremely low bitrates, and using MJPEG causes recorded files to be double the size of a camera that uses h264 a camera with the NT96650 like a B40/A118 or real G1W will have a bitrate between 13-15MB and have WDR letting it record decent night time video and will use h264 to keep file sizes lower. Ontop of the poor specs and horrible video the menu is a bit hard to navigate. The menu button is on the side. Once you get into the menu you have to keep hitting the menu button to cycle through the different settings. Then you have to use up and down to pick a setting then hit the OK button to select it. If you hit the menu button again the setting choice you selected will not be saved and you will have to go all the way back around and set it again. The firmware version on my camera is 21181.\n",

      "Message: I have been doing field recordings, primarily but not exclusively of live concerts (both clandestine and not) since I first bought a Sony TC-D5M in 1982. It cost $475. I replaced that in about 1990 with the Sony TCD-D3 DAT recorder, which cost about the same and was of course far superior (48KHz/16b)...when it worked. Now comes a whole new breed of portable stereo audio recorders. I selected this for a number of reasons, not the least being that it's inexpensive, very lightweight, has that Tascam (Teac) brand name, the sampling rate is selectable between 16b and 24b, it got good reviews, records to cheap SD cards, and it has a removable Li-ion battery with a long life.\n",

      "One of the major reasons why I got this adapter, aside form owning a Nikon DSLR, and several Nikkor lenses. Is for the crop factor of 2.7x. Which for all intents and purposes gives one further reach when used with telephoto / zoom lenses. So the 70-300mm VR G that I own may be 450mm max equivalent, on a DX camera. On a Nikon 1 system camera, that maximum increases to roughly 810mm. This reach is very obvious when you compare images of the same distant scene, and in fact can produce distortion related to heat being put off by the planets surface( when reaching out miles ).\n",

The only problem is that there is NO room for error and if you are a little crooked, you will get massive air bubbles on the side that will not go away. If you choose the white tablet there is no problem as the air bubbles are unoticable. But, on the black version, bubbles pop up very clearly.\n",

Note:  the external DVR drives used with Dish Network [MUST] have their own power supply - so, I also bought a power-strip for transformers (the transformers are turned 90-degrees, and there's a surge-suppressor), which allows all FOUR (4) external drives to remain powered-up.

Instructions were mostly clear.  There aren't that many things to figure out honestly so you can pretty much feel your way through.  This is 100% reversible. You can remove it and send in your card for warranty if something happens.  It's super quiet.  Can't hear anything at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: The rear heat sink is extremely heavy, but since it came with a bracket, it doesn't really matter.  However, the thermal pads that came with the kit is way too thick. There are only 4 screws holding the front AND back heat sink in place.  When I tighten it down, it would bend my card because of the thick thermal pads.  If I loosen it, the front heat sink is not tight enough to press onto the GPU chip. So I left out the rear heat sink.  The C clamps didn't quite fit as well.  It's too small, again, mainly because of the think thermal pads.  But because the C clamps act double duty to clamp down the rear heat sink and attached to the bracket, I had to rig something to attached them to the card without the rear heat sink. Overall, the rear heat sink is a bad design.  This does not come with any memory heat sinks as well where as the Turbo II does.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final thoughts: Worth it for the front heat sink alone. I got this because the Turbo II doesn't come with a bracket.  Everyone said it's heavy and it puts stress on the card so that's why I got this.  But like I said, this doesn't come with memory heat sinks.  You will need to get your own if your card doesn't already have it.  Perhaps I can get some thinner thermal pads and try to put the rear heat sink back on but as of now, I left it out.  Doesn't seem to affect the main GPU chip's temp, but no idea about the memory temps because they don't have any sensors on them.  However, since the front heat sink fan is so good, I only knock off 1 star for the rear heat sink.\n",

      "Message: I was looking for a rolling backpack as much like the one I had worn out as possible. I found it in this J World Laptop Rolling Backpack. It came today and as usual I just cut out the thick pad for the laptop since I won't use it, loaded it with my stuff and I'm good to go. I love the big smooth rolling wheels and the easy glide handle. It was a steal at 53.00 which included shipping. I got black which is my preferred color. I like having a smaller pocket at the top where I can drop my keys, my cell phone, my small flashlight and, alas, my pepper spray. I've had other backpacks that did not have this pocket and vowed to never buy another one that didn't have it. It's soooo convenient. Thanks Amazon.  OVER A YEAR LATER: Just ordered a second one though the other one is still good. Wanted a lighter color for summer. Have given all my other rolling backpacks to the mission downtown since these are just so much better than any others I have found. A year later - both the others are still good but I wanted something bright for spring and summer. I got the Green with yellow flowers. They call it Khaki but it's green thank goodness. Again, cut out the place for the Laptop and I'm ready for summer. I get lots of compliments on these backpacks. STILL LATER:  I'm now on my 4th bag like this.  None of them ever wore out.  When I got tired of the color I gave the bag to the Mission so some street person could use it.  The one I have now is the Paisley and I just love the color.  It is my very favorite so far. I want to say that I give my bags hard wear.  I do a lot of walking and shopping and sometimes put too much stuff in one of these but I've never had one fail.  Wheels still work fine, handle still works fine, zippers still work fine. STILL LATER.  I am now on my 5th one of these I guess.  I got the blue with roses s*** time and it looks great.  I always give my old one to the mission for the homeless people who love rolling bags.  I get a lot of compliments on my bags.\n",

This Digiant has a wider base for greater sturdiness and security. It is much more plasticky feeling than other monopods that I've tried, but it's still a pretty good value. If this were a little less expensive then it would be a greater value. Overall it's better then a lot of the competition out there which makes it worth it.\n",

The sound it makes when the heads park/un-park is somewhat alarming.  I have had too many drives fail after making a clunking sound from the heads.  Although this sound is not the clicking sound of death, the clunk it makes is very disconcerting.

      "Message: the first day I used this camera, the Auto focus wouldn't work and the lens kept spinning back and forth on my tamron 35mm for several seconds until it eventually focused. It kept doing this red AF warning thing in the camera. I tested it again the 2nd day on a different lens, my tamron 85mm. At one point, the lens didn't even budge for a while and it refused to focus at all and but then later after changing out the lens back and forth, it did again. Then I tried it on the 35mm lens again and while shooting in live view the screen kept flickering and making these loud weird noises. I can't tell the difference in image quality from my d3300 which I got for $900 cheaper and I had almost no problems on the d3300. By the way, both the lenses I above mentioned worked flawlessly on my d3300 immediately after and I have video to prove it all. I researched the d750 vigorously and was very disappointed with the result.\n",

Better than Wren by a small bit (close call Wren!), and significantly better than the Audioengine B2 and Polk Audio Woodbourne (refurbished was in price range). Maybe it's the studio monitor heritage?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a clear win for the Ceres based on OUR priorities, but if you want almost as good sound and a prettier, more compact package I can confidently recommend the Wren as well... just make sure you buy the model with your preferred connection method (e.g. BT, Airplay, etc).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite looking nicer than the Presonus system and all being fairly pleasant to listen to in isolation, each of the other bluetooth speaker sets had shortcomings compared to the Ceres:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Audioengine B2's tone was well balanced, and the Bluetooth range was nice, but the soundstage was just simply too small sounding. Very compact, loved the veneer and speaker look.\n",
      "- Woodbourne had lots of connection options, but sounded bass heavy and a little \"muddy,\" and had some Bluetooth and Airplay connection quirks; the iOS app is necessary for wifi and Airplay but not very helpful otherwise. Large but pretty design.\n",
      "- The Wren was a close second, more balanced tone than the others with a nice soundstage for the size, but still not quite as clear and natural as the Ceres. Compact and nice to look at.\n",
      "- The Presonus Ceres presented a wider sound stage than the others even with the speakers within a foot of each other, and they maintained a beautiful, authentic, clear sound which was much more \"believable.\" In other words, the musicians sounded like they were in the room... we drifted into the music much more readily with them, and isn't that what you buy speakers for? :-)\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course your music and tone preferences may vary, and all four systems are nice. Also some may not want the footprint of two speakers with a wire, or may not like the look of plain (and I mean seriously PLAIN) black boxes... but if your priority is crystal clear accurate sound the Ceres C4.5BT are your sub-$500 bluetooth choice.\n",

The lag was intermittent, so it may be an interference issue, but all I have is a computer, a TV, a modem and a cable box, which I assume is what most people have if they are buying this. I am going to try one other dongle-based wireless keyboard and then give up and stick with bluetooth ones which are more expensive and have their own issues.\n",

The advantages are many - I find it much sharper, easier to handhold than the white lens at 200, it is possible to take it to affairs where they will not allow the big white lens, and much, much, MUCH less conspicuous.
